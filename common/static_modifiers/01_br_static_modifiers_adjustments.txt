	#discipline = 0.05			#BTAddOn removed. I see why this is here and appreciate the reasoning, but upon extensive consideration, I want to keep discipline out of absolutism.

Moving this bonus to professionalism, for what should be obvious reasons. # Harb's Autonomy Overhaul
	#all_power_cost	= -0.05			#BTAddOn added. Very powerful compensation for losing Admin Efficiency, hopefully putting to rest any whining about that. Note again, the description of absolutism does read 'how efficient' the government is, so this seems fitting. # Harb's Autonomy Overhaul

	#I feel the idea behind absolutism is relegating all power away from, well, the estates of the realm, leaving the Monarch absolute. As such, estates should definitely become disloyal. This also makes a lot more sense mechanically, since now the player has a lot more control over how they handle their state. If they run headfirst into high absolutism with highly influential estates, they will definitely run into issues, what with them turning disloyal. As well, unrest will naturally rise as estates become disloyal at high absolutism, and other modifiers will have a degree of impact to try and offset Absolutism's bonuses.
