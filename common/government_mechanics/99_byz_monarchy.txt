# Representing the Byzantine monarchy, or monarchic theocracy, as it is referred to by historians, is a bit of a mess. What we do know is the following:
# -The Empire had no formal imperial succession because it was by law, still a republic. Emperors were elected practically by the military.
# -This highly militarised Empire essentially means that "bigger army diplomacy" (CGP Grey) rules.
# -Emperors managed to secure succession using honorary titles as co-emperors for their children.


# This government will not generate heirs automatically - the "Introduce heir" button must be used in order to name someone co-emperor, and this button will generate a heir
# of your dynasty.

# Using this idea, I want to represent the Byzantine monarchy's government mechanics as a set of ever-growing powers. These powers are:
# -Military Influence (Megas Domestikos - Strategoi. Pre-Themes: Dynatoi)
# -Administrative Influence (Megas Sakellarios - Dynatoi)
# -State Official Influence (Megas Logothethes - Syntechnioi)

# This system will replace the factions that were integrated from Renovatio Imperii.

# Each has a 0-100 power that grows naturally by +1/year per 100% estate influence, with an additional +1/year if no heir apparent exists. 
# If it reaches 100, a disaster starts ticking at +5/month that will result in a Civil War of sorts, with pretenders rising up:
# Megas Domestikos:
# +40% Strategoi Influence (Dynatoi pre-Theme System)
# +30% Manpower Recovery Speed
# +0.4 Monthly Byzantine Militarization
# -40% Military Advisor Cost

# Megas Sakellarios:
# +40% Dynatoi Influence
# +20% Tax Modifier
# -2 Interest
# -40% Admin Advisor Cost

# Megas Logothetes:
# +40% Syntechnioi Influence
# +20% Production Efficiency
# +4 Diplomatic Reputation
# -40% Diplomatic Advisor Cost

# These can be paid down with 20 power, costing 20 monarch points of each respective category.
# At above 80 power in each, bad events start occuring.
# The events will generally lower estate loyalty, give corruption and cause a modifier negating one of the buffs for 5 years. They pulse on a 2 year timer.
# If kept between 20-50, good events occur.
# The events will increase estate loyalty, reduce corruption and give additional modifiers for 5 years:
# Domestikos: -20% General Cost
# Sakellarios: -10% Development Cost
# Logothetes: +25% Spy Defense

# In total, this is somewhat a nerf in that it increases influence of estates and the size of the modifiers have generally gotten smaller.
# It's also a slight buff because you can experience all modifiers at once, compared to the Faction system, and the drawbacks for each modifier are gone.

#Also adding militarisation which has a bunch of fun bonuses. Tie these to missions! More army!
