#DISCLAIMER: I am not Greek myself, I do not speek Greek and all I know of Greek is by googling a bit on the internet and trying to figure out how to pronounce things. Do note that every B shall be pronounced as v.
#Also, if no Greek equivalent exists, the names are either transliterated to Greek from Roman counterparts, picked from more important cities in the vicinity or if none of these exist, translated from their etymology.
#Another thing: I know that the "Rh" does not exist in Greek and is merely a Roman transliteration thing. But I wanted it there because... it looks cooler, I suppose?
