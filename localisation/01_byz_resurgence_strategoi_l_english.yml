 estate_generals_desc:0 "This estate represents the military generals of the Byzantine Empire. In the 7th century, whereupon the establishment of the Theme System sttled the Empire's field armies, their roles also ended up including provincial governance. Due to the initial size of the original themes, they held great power, often being rebellious and in conflict with the Emperor. Later on however, as the original themes were split up, as well as new Themes being established in newly conquered territories, their inidividual power waned substantially. Later, their responsibility as provincial governors ended up being moved to a group called the kritai, or judges. The Empire also saw the introduction of Doukes and Katepano, who governed several Themes at a time, as well as several adjustments to Byzantine civil military hierarchy, greatly weakening Strategoi influence. The Themata saw their end after the battle of Manzikert in 1071, when the Seljuks took over most of Anatolia. The remaining western themes were later abolished and were replaced by the Tagmata, which ended up as the main military force fielded by the Byzantines up until the establishment of the Pronoia in the late Komnenian period, bearing way for a more feudal-esque military. \n\nNow that the Theme System has been re-established, their position as provincial holders and leader of field armies settled in our lands have finally been revitalized. Non-capital provinces containing forts and regimental camps are designated Theme capitals and will serve as seats of military governance."
