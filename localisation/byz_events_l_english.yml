 convert_to_catholicism_title: "Convert to Catholicism"
 convert_to_catholicism_desc: "Ever since the the Schism of 1054, the Christian faith has been divided by East and West. The Eastern Orthodox church of the Byzantine Empire has especially hated the Catholic Latins ever since the atrocities commited during the Sack of Constantinople in 1204 and the installation of the Latin Empire. However, now there is a greater problem: The Muslim Ottoman Turks have entered Europe and threaten the very existance of what remains of the Roman Empire. The Palaiologan has looked towards the West for help against the heathens, and have even converted to Catholicism to garner support. Ioannes VIII even secured a Union of the Churches at the Coucil of Florence, but opposition in the Byzantine Empire kept it from having any real power. If the Basileus had all the authority in the church, he may able to sway the people to convert to Catholicism, and hopefully gain more support in the West to kick out the Turks."
