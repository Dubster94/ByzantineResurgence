 resurgent_BYZ.2.d:0 "The Black Sea trade has historically been a great source of income for the Empire. However, as the Empire's influence and power waned after the battle of Mantzikert when the Seljuks settled in Anatolia, the area saw the arrival of Latin merchants in the Black Sea, which was expanded greatly after the events of the 4th Crusade. In return for the Genoese helping in recovering Constantinople, the then Emperor of Nicaea Michael VIII Palaiologos would expel the Venetians from the Black Sea in favor of the Genoese. While Michael did indeed expel the Venetians from the Black Sea strait, the Empire would never recover and its power would keep waning as the encroaching turks conquered more and more of the Empire. \n\nConsidering that the Empire has now risen from the ashes, we have reason to offer a treaty to the Genoese merchants that greatly increases their trade potential, in exchange for placing their Black Sea trading posts directly under our rule."

With both horse and horseman being fully clad in armour, armed with either a lance and small shield or a bow, when the unit would charge in line formation against the enemy there were few that would dare to even face them. Some historians revere them as the counterpart of the Legionnaires of Rome as a symbol of their military might.

In particular, it mentions the constructions of great aqueducts, mills, as well as a peculiar machine known as the Aeolipile that seemingly generates torque with the use of boiling water. Not only that, it also describes how to pump and elevate water upwards, something which is certain to come in handy for the purposes of mining, but also sawing timber and grinding wheat. Finally, there's this very small passage about how to create a substance he calls 'Caeruleum', called 'Kyanos' in Greek, meaning 'blue'.\n\nIt is clear that this book houses many marvels and things that we could benefit from.

Once the city fell to the Roman Empire after a disastrous siege, however, the city was left in such a poor state that it was considered uninhabitable. Emperor Hadrian in year 130 vowed to rebuild the city of Jerusalem as a gift to the Jewish people and restore the Second Temple that had been so thoroughly destroyed. When visiting the ruins, however, he was advised that rebuilding it would cause the Jews to rebel against the Empire. As such, Jerusalem instead was rebuilt into a Roman colony, including temples for Roman paganism. Perhaps ironically, this sparked an event known as the Bar Kokhba revolt, one of three conflicts conducted between the Roman Emperors and the Jews. This uprising enraged Hadrian, who put down the revolt and placed a ban on the Jewish people, prohibiting them from ever setting foot in the city except on the day of Tisha B'Av. Entering the city on any other day as a Jew was punishable by death. The city was renamed Aelia Capitolina and the roman province changed from Judea to Syria Palestina. As such, the city was transformed into a soldier camp up until Emperor Constantine I, when the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built and the city's See was granted special honour, to later on become the seat of a Patriarch. These events resulted in the city becoming completely depopulated of Jews, which remained the case for the remainder of Roman rule.

 resurgent_BYZ.37.t:0 "The Rediscovery of Greek Fire"
 resurgent_BYZ.37.d:0 "Greek Fire was the name given to the substance deployed by the Greeks, both on water with their Dromons and later on land with catapults. The more famous ship variant was deployed by method of a \"siphon\", a tube-shaped projector, whereas the land version on catapults was deployed through soaking cloth-clad caltrops in the substance. Said to be invented by Kallinikos from Heliopolis in Phoenice when he arrived to Constantinople in 672, it was used with great success in combating the Arabs, supposedly playing an integral part in repelling them from the 1st (674-678) and 2nd (717-718) siege of Constantinople. It later on also played a part in some decisive victories against the Saracens under the resurgence of the Macedonian dynasty, civil wars as well as during wars against the Bulgars and the Rus'. Said to not be extinguished by water, it was revered highly among the Byzantines. In the famous book called De Administrando Imperio, it was described as a gift from the heavens, a divine intervention, claimed to have been \"shown and revealed by an angel to the great and holy first Christian emperor Constantine\". The recipe was guarded heavily in an attempt to make sure it never fell into enemy hands. Despite this, the substance itself was successfully acquired by the Empire's enemies, such as the Bulgars and the Arabs, however they never replicated the method of deployment used by the Byzantines. Instead, in the case of the Arabs, similar incendiary substances were deployed with catapults and grenades instead of \"by siphon\". There is however one account where the Crusaders claim to have seen the Saracens use \"Greek Fire\" in the 13th century. What the substance itself consisted of was never known; some early accounts claim it to be based on niter or phosphide, however most scholars today claim it to be based on naphta, crude oil, perhaps gathered from the wells in the Black Sea around Tamatarcha (Today called Taman) or the Middle East. This in part may explain the sudden disappearance of Greek Fire following the sack of Constantinople in the 4th crusade, never to be used by the Byzantines again."
