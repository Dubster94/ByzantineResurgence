 estate_exarches:0 "Exarches"
 estate_exarches_desc:0 "This estate saw their place as Emperor Maurice attempted to ease the overextension of the Empire since Justinian I's conquests. Establishing the two exarches of Italy and Africa, with the former being more commonly known by its seat Ravenna, these two exarches were supreme civil and military commanders of the region they were in control of. They enjoyed a great degree of autonomy and were considered the sole authority in the region. At times the Exarches even competed for power in Constantinople, with one particular occurence of the Exarch of Africa leading a rebellion against the usurper Phocas said to have slain Maurice. The exarches were short-lived as the Empire came under attack from all sides, with Lombards in Italy, muslims in Africa, persians on the Eastern border and Avars and Slavs in the Balkans. The exarchate of Ravenna saw a rebirth in the Katepanate of Italy, however even this administrative unit was conquered, marking an end to Byzantine holdings outside of the Balkans and Anatolia."

 establish_exarch_of_hesperia_title:0 "Establish the Exarch of Hesperia"
 establish_exarch_of_hesperia_desc:0 "In the days of Ioustinianos I, he conquered vast stretches of land. His armies made it to the Iberian peninsula, in Greek known as Hesperia and a province of Spania was established. Due to it mainly serving as protection against the then visigoths for the African holdings and Ioustinianos never completely finished his ideas of a restored Empire, it never received much attention until its later loss in 624. Our ambitions are bigger than that, however. We shall establish an Exarch in the region. Let us establish it in the city of Empeiros, the historical capital of the region."
 establish_exarch_of_galatia_title:0 "Establish the Exarch of Galatia"
 establish_exarch_of_galatia_desc:0 "We have managed to do something no Emperor since the fall of West Rome has done - We have spread our influence to the region of Gallia, or Galatia in Greek tongue. As our administration for far lands relies on the establishment of Exarches, we should make haste and seat one in the city of Treberon - its historical capital."

 establish_exarch_of_ravenna_title:0 "Establish the Exarch of Ravenna"
 establish_exarch_of_ravenna_desc:0 "Ruling from Constantinople, Basileus Maurikios I found the Empire shortly upon his ascension overextended. To remedy this, he established two Exarch states, both ruled by an appointed Exarch whom held sole civil and military authority in the region. One of them was the Exarchate of Ravenna. Having conquered the city in the name of Rome, we shall thus once more establish its Exarchate!"
 establish_exarch_of_anatolia_title:0 "Establish the Exarch of the Orient"
 establish_exarch_of_anatolia_desc:0 "As our eurocentric policies have set our sights on the West with the moving of the Imperial capital to Italy, the lands in the East are no longer as close to our seat of administration. As such, establishing an Exarch of the Orient, Anatolia in Greek tongue, could prove beneficial as to allow efficient governance."
 establish_exarch_of_aegyptus_title:0 "Establish the Exarch of Egypt"
 establish_exarch_of_aegyptus_desc:0 "Considering our seat of administration has been moved to Italy, the region of Egypt has moved further away from our capital. While the region historically has been very easy to hold onto, since the rise of the Arabs and the muslims, the region has become increasingly violent. This move thus necessitates us establishing an Exarch in the region if we wish the region to be governed effectively."
