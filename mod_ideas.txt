#Future potential content:
-Tie unique parliamentary issues to missions?
-Tie new government mechanics to parliamentary issues?

-Adjust Latin Imperial Authority to a new government mechanic.
-Work on additional LTE missions to show up below Emperor Crusader missions, akin to what Russia has in Domination.

Latin Empire's Knightly Orders:
-------------------------------
- Needs estate privileges
- Needs estate events

Privilege ideas:
-Knightly Orders: Allow for a unique type of mercenary company for the Latin Empire.
-Need their other estate interactions reworked into privileges.

#1.30 ideas:
-Estates: Can no longer own provinces directly. How to solve?
-Align Pentarchy/East Oriental Schism missions to the system the new Papal mission "Mend the Schism" mission will use?




WIP: The below is currently in the process of being implemented.
Started work on the following. It is currently not fully implemented however.
-Added two new Imperial incidents. If the Emperor DLC is not detected, these events will fire regardless, as all that is DLC content is the HRE voting on the issue.
	-The Siege of Constantinople: Fires upon Ottomans declaring war on a Catholic Byzantium.
		-The Emperor gets the choice to join in against the Ottomans to help Byzantium or not through an imperial incident.
			-If the Emperor chooses to join in, Byzantium must concede to join the Empire in order for the Emperor to actually join in.
				-If Byzantium does this, the Emperor may further choose to call in the Imperial electors to join the war.
					-The Emperor may also spend 20 imperial authority, if available, to force all electors to join in (AI will never pick this option).
					-The Imperial electors will otherwise choose to accept dependent on current war situation.

Initial idea layout:
-Imperial incidents:
	The Fate of Byzantium:
		Will trigger if Ottomans are attacking Byzantium AND Byzantium has converted to Catholicism.
		If Byzantium requests help:
		Will send out events to the Emperor, Venice, Genoa and the Pope.
			Based on relations Byzantium has with the Emperor and current state of the Empire (Not at war with outside powers, for example), the Emperor may decide to join.
				The Emperor will send an ultimatum to Byzantium to join the Holy Roman Empire. If they accept, the Emperor joins in.
					If the Emperor joins, Electors also get an event where they decide to join, again based on relations and if they're at war already.
			Based on relations Byzantium has to the Pope and if they're at war or not, the Pope may decide to join.
				If the Pope joins, his Autonomous Papal States will get an event where they decide to join, again based on relations and if they're at war already.
				Byzantium will in return get a modifier on Constantinople giving +3% missionary strength.
			Based on relations Byzantium has with Venice and if Venice have enough trade power in the Aegean Sea/Constantinople, they may decide to join.
				Venice will then send an ultimatum to Byzantium to concede something.
					Byzantium gets to choose between:
						-Conceding Myrina 				(25% chance)
						-Conceding Patras 				(50% chance)
						-Transferring Athens vassal 	(90% chance)
					Success chance increases as offers get greater.
					If Venice joins, their trade league members also get an event where they decide to join, again based on relations and if they're at war already.
					Byzantium will in return get a Venetian mercenary company to recruit in Constantinople.
			Based on relations Byzantium has with Genoa, Genoa may decide to join.
				Genoa will then send an ultimatum to Byzantium to choose between:
						-Conceding Myrina 				(50% chance)
						-Conceding Patras				(75% chance)
						-Transferring Lesbian vassal	(100% chance)
					Success chance increases as offers get greater.
					If Genoa joins, theit trade league members also get an event where they decide to join, again based on relations and if they're at war already.
					Byzantium will in return get the famous Genoese leader Giovanni Guistiniani for the duration of the war.
					
					
		EDIT: Cutting down most of this chain here to instead just concern the Emperor. 
			The Genoese part is already represented as part of the Aragonese chain. Venice would likely also rather just opportunistically knock on their door.
			Alternatively, Venice could be considered as a separate event and/or offer.

Decisions:
----------
Decision to form Dacia as a Romanian-cultured nation. Should rename Hunedoara to Sarmisegetusa.

#Ideas#
#######

-Exarch Ravenna: Option to not cede Magna Graecia to Ravenna? Will cause issues with Exarch state blocking stating of provinces. Not sure.

-Something mentioning the Monastery of the Pantocrator (Zeyrek Mosque) and how Byzantine emperors upon their death were buried there since the Komnenoi period.

Byzantine Succession Mechanics:
-------------------------------
Byzantine succession was non-hereditary, but was especially in the late Empire treated as if it was, with the firstborn son generally being expected to rule, being named co-emperor rather early. Generally, that is how it worked.
Second sons and whatever were of course also granted land to govern, in the event that an emperor had no sons, meaning the rule would go to their younger brothers.
This has led me to think that all Byzantium needs are flavour events to send your heirs to govern in a region.
Akin to that of the Ottoman succession, there has been times where ambitious sons have attempted to exploit their position of governance being closer to Constantinople to overthrow whoever is next in line.
Thus, this means we shall create an event where provincial governors that are second or third sons can rebel, spawning pretender rebels.

Add event to pick heir to Byzantium before formalizing succession laws:
-----------------------------------------
This is difficult in many ways actually, because the heirs were essentially named emperors and technically speaking anyone could become emperor. 
Let's also mention the fact that the Emperor would always want the Basileus title to stay in the family.
Is it even right to put a whole idea towards formalizing succession laws? Is this really the way forward for Byzantium? Why is it forced upon the player as part of the idea set?
To be fair, I'd much prefer a system that is fleshed out, gives you the ability to choose what monarch points you want, similar to republics, however has the disadvantage with a lot of rebels and civil war-like stuff.
If I create that, I can then make two different paths - one is to formalize succession laws and stabilize the realm, disabling these rebellions to a greater extent, and the other one is to keep it, but cause issues.
We could make a system similar to the Ottoman government, however the issue is that attempting to mess with the way vanilla generates heirs is... tough, and may cause very unforeseen consequences.
To be fair, I'd really need to do a proper playthrough *as* the Ottomans to actually try to determine how their heir generation *actually* works - can they even get heirs not generated through event?
I can report that no, Ottos do not get heirs generated through vanilla mechanics. That also causes issues for Byzantium because they cannot get PU'd if we do it that way.

Potential succesion mechanics?
------------------------------
- The first event occurs when your ruler is 30.
	- You can pick your firstborn son as your heir (90% chance of this occuring).
	- It allows you to pick your favourite son or daughter (50% chance) if you have a firstborn son.
		- This'll cause the firstborn to rebel as a pretender once your ruler dies.
	- I would love to allow for advisors and generals to become heirs, but that is currently not possible within the EU4 engine.
- The second event occurs when your ruler is 40.
	- Here you have the chance of picking your firstborn child as your heir (50% chance of there being one)
	- If you do not have a son here, your advisors express worry for you and contenders for the throne start to rise up.
- You get your last chance if your ruler hits 50.
	- Here's a 25% chance of producing a child.
- If you do not have a child, it fires the Succession Crisis disaster upon your ruler dying?

Disasters:
----------
A disaster for Byzantium that converts to Catholic, perhaps also applicable for a Byzantium whose ruler is still Catholic as well.

Events:
-------
Events focusing on the Schism?  To be fair, not sure what to add to it. Maybe something to deal with the recovery from the Council of Florence? But I don't know what to implement...
Events focusing on relations between Byzantine Empire & Holy Roman Empire? Should there be a border friction CB for either Empire if they border?
Event that causes major uprising from Exarch seat if pretender rebels enforce demands? It did happen historically. Did I add this? I forgot.
Event chain for Byzantium to assign heirs to govern in a certain area of the Empire. The area gets bonuses for being governed until the death of the ruler.
- The heir can choose to rebel by random event.
- If the heir has been assigned, a random event can occur that sends a second heir to another area of governance.
- This heir will persist past the death of the ruler and will actually guarantee a new heir if you choose.
- Should you decide against picking this guy as an heir, he'll rebel.
- Another random event that can occur is making your heir a general.

Government Forms:
-----------------
Note that generally these ideas are something I cannot or are very difficult to implement with the current Ruler/Heir mechanics
NOTE: These'll probably be gone by 1.26.

The Roman Republic:
- Allows royal marriages (& personal unions)? Is there even a point to this?
- Represented by two rulers. Thus, the idea is to use the consort system to elect two people. If the main ruler dies, consort replaces the main ruler and new consort is elected.
- This will lock this particular government form behind Rights of Man.
Elections yearly, will have the following (Preliminary and likely to change):
- Re-election (Lose 2 rep. trad., no stat changes)
	- Elect ruler of same dynasty (Lose 2 rep. trad., random ruler of same dynasty, maximum is same as current ruler's max, minimum is same as current ruler's min)
	- Elect someone from the Senate (Random ruler (Max 3 in all stats but adm & dip, which is max 4), influence and loyalty for the Syntechnoi. Production efficiency goes up.)
	- Elect someone from the Magistrates (Random ruler (Max 3 in all stats but mil, which is max 4), influence & loyalty for the Dynatoi. Discipline goes up.)
	- Elect someone from the commonfolk (Random ruler (Max 3 in all stats), nobility & burghers lose loyalty, national unrest goes down & morale goes up.)

Units:
-----------
Much like what is now available since Third Rome with Streltsy & Cossack units as well as Banners in MoH, there should be a similar unique unit category that drafts from theme capitals.
Maybe we can call them Tourma or Themata. Having more of these units similarly to Streltsy shall grant higher morale, however will increase Strategoi influence, meaning there is a soft cap on how many of these you can have.
Alternatively some other sort of elite unit of the Empire.
To my knowledge, this feature isn't fully moddable yet.

Another thing could be the Cataphract unique unit. Preliminary, you'd be limited by a scale that depends on your total goods produced of the Iron trade good.

In all honesty as a side note, making a mod for Ottoderp that allows them to draft Janissary regiments from Dhimmi provinces or just provinces that are not of turkish culture wouldn't be half bad either.
It's funny I said that back in 1.22 because it did flippin' happen in 1.23. ^^
