Byz Resurgence 8.0.0

Features:
-This patch features a fairly comprehensive rework of Byzantium, implementing and applying previously infeasible due to modding limitations or gameplay meta, and ideas pondered over the years. This should ensure a fresh new experience for Byzantium.
	-The Byzantine mission tree has been overhauled for a 4th time, marking the entry of the 4th iteration of the Byzantine mission tree, with a grand total of 123 missions.
		-The mission tree has been reworked to include a LOT more flavour-related missions. Previously, there were a mere 14 flavour missions in the Byzantine tree. Now it includes a total of 69 flavour missions.
			-Flavour missions now span the entirety of the Roman Empire, though a lot of them are concentrated around the central parts of the Empire, that being the Balkans and Anatolia.
				-Featuring establishment of Themes, Exarches, production focuses of certain regions, building buildings, handling of estates, religious matters, conversions, development, you name it!
				-In addition, pure conquest missions' rewards have been retooled, moving away from 10 year modifiers most of the time to give a more instantaneous bonus.
		-The addition of so many flavour missions necessitated a complete redrawal of the tree. Now where the Rhenus border mission was at row 22, the mission tree has only reached its midpoint, now ending at row 38.
		-Unfortunately, due to the change and work put into the new iteration, the Persian branch of the mission tree, which consisted of about 10 conquest missions and nothing else, was cut for the time being.
			-This particular branch is likely to resurface as part of a future Greece mission tree update. Byzantium as a tag has become a Roman Restoration as far as this is concerned.
			-Future long-term plans for Greece includes:
				-Two separate branches, one focusing on creating a tall Greece focusing on Greek philosophy and ideas, and the other a wide Greece that emulates ancient Alexander's Persianate Greece.
				-A path for Byzantium forming Greece, dropping the Roman identity and embracing old Greek ideals.
					-If possible, this path would be co-authored with Pagan Wrath's dev.
					-The path would involve the advisor Gemisthos Plethon, as well as losing Constantinople tag-swapping Byzantium into Morea, as this is the only feasible path I can see towards a Byzantium forming Greece.
	-Byzantium's startup is heavily overhauled.
		-Byzantium now starts with 6 negative estate privileges for the Dynatoi called <Family name> Latifundia. These indicate the incredibly influential and wealthy dynasties of the Byzantine Empire that crippled the central government during the Palaiologan period. Each of these prevent seizing land from the Dynatoi, and revoking them is the only way to curb their massive land share in the Empire. Revoking them, however, results in massive revolts throughout the Empire, the size depending on how large the Latifundia is, signified by how much influence it gives.
		-Byzantium also has several bad modifiers at the game start.
			-"Council of Florence", which negatively impacts the state, giving -3 tolerance of true faith, but gives +25 relations with heretics.
				-This modifier is revoked through the Byzantine mission "A Question of Schismatics" if you complete the mission without triggering the the disaster "Union of Two Churches".
			-"Foreign Merchants", which negative impacts Byzantine economy, giving -10% trade efficiency and -20% global trade power.
				-This modifier is revoked through the new Byzantine mission "State Trade Hegemon"
			-"Foreign Fleet", which negatively impacts the Byzantine navy, giving them -5% disengagement chance, -10% ship durability as well as -50% national sailors modifier.
				-This modifier is revoked through the new Byzantine mission "Restore the Navy"
			-"Hyperinflation", which gives +0.2 yearly inflation.
				-This modifier is revoked through the new Byzantine mission "Revive the Hyperpyron".
			-"Lack of Levies", which gives -10% national manpower modifier and -10% manpower recovery speed.
				-This modifier is revoked through the Byzantine mission "The Imperial Army"
			-The Byzantine unique government reforms that gave new mechanics have been cut and replaced with vanilla's two Byzantine T1 government reforms, albeit modified:
				-The starting government reform has major maluses in the beginning of the game to symbolize the large decentralization of the Empire and the lack of power in the Byzantine Crown.
					-This government reform has -10% reform progress as well as +0.05 autonomy change.
					-The mechanic of "civil war on every new ruler" is now re-enabled. As such, Byzantium has to deal with a stack of Pretender Rebels each time a new monarch comes onto the throne.
						-The first "civil war on every new ruler" is custom-flavoured, repurposing the Demetrios Palaiologos event.
				-Upon completing the mission "Byzantine Resurgence" you are awarded with a better T1 government reform, and you can start accumulating unique government mechanics.
					-This reformed Byzantine monarchy has the following unlockable government mechanics:
						-Pronoiar: 
							-Upon completing "Revoke the Latifundia!", Byzantium gets three incredibly immersive buttons to press, similar to the old Iqta system in previous patches. These however give bonuses not based on subjects, but on own state development. 
							-The ability to press them is also dependent on the amount of pronoia power that has been accumulated, which grows based on monarch administrative skill. 
							-As a sidenote, completing this mission also renames the nobles from Dynatoi to Penetes.
						-Protostrategos Prominence: 
							-Upon completing "Basileus Protostrategos", the Byzantines get access to Protostrategos Prominence. This mechanic resets upon monarch death, and forces your ruler as a general. 
							-Protostrategos Prominence grows as part of winning battles, and decreases as part of losing battles, with your monarch. Increasing it nets bonuses to army drilling, as well as Strategoi loyalty.
						-Byzantine Bureaucracy: 
							-Upon completing "Byzantine Bureacucracy", Byzantium gets access to six government powers representing different Logothetes, or 'accountants', that deal with different things in your Empire. 
							-Their power growth is dependent on a variety of factors similar to the old Byzantine Factions such as stability, army tradition, mercantilism, and so on. 
							-Up until 50 power, these Logothete simply grant a bonus to your nation. Once they go above 50 however, they start reducing all other Logothetes' power, and also grant a yearly corruption modifier. 
							-You can reduce their power by 5 by paying 5 monarch points in their respective category to balance them.
					-As a sidenote, with regards to these government mechanics, I could not get the interface to align more than 3 icons per line, causing the interface to take up much more space than required. This appears to be a hardcoded limit that other modders have stumbled upon, so there is little I can do to fix the necessary scrolling to see all buttons. A bandaid would be to adjust the entire interface, but that is not something I am willing to do at the moment.
					-I would also take the opportunity to credit the user by the name of Roi that created the Byzantine Militarization icon as well as the Pronoiar icons back in the day. The graphics for these two government mechanics are using those that Roi created.
-The Latin Imperial mission trees have been cut as a result of vanilla adding the Latin Empire, while me simultaneously not having updated them for a while, simultaneously to them not being particularly impressive.
	-In general, Latin Imperial content has been put on hold for a while.
	-Future long-term plans for the Latin Empire includes:
		-Custom UI for the Latin Imperial Authority
		-Custom mechanics, akin to that of Empire of China, for the Latin Empire such that it can centralise itself.
		-A tweaking of the Knightly Orders to become akin to that of Byzantium's new Pronoiar mechanic, being establishable using existing tags.
-The Varangian Guards mercenary companies can now drill by default.
-The Strategoi estate finally has Estate Agendas. Now featuring 8 different Estate Agendas, all about dealing with your Theme Capitals and improving them, or recruiting generals and giving them privileges.
-A new monument: The Library of Alexandria. Only restorable by decision, restoring this monument allows you to bring important books from all over the world to it, making it a beacon of knowledge once more. The restoration changes the province trade goods to Books.
	-The monument has the following bonuses:
		T1: +50% Provincial Institution Spread (Starting Tier)
		T2: +50% Provincial Institution Spread, +1 Goods Produced, +50% Areal Institution Spread, +50% Innovativeness Gain
		T3: +100% Areal Institution Spread, +3 Goods Produced,  +100% Innovativeness Gain, -10% Idea Cost
	-This monument has a branching event chain associated with it, rediscovering the book known as De Architectura. From this book you can choose between one of four important things, or do all four if your ruler is a scholar:
		-A modifier that grants great project upgrade cost reductions
		-A modifier that grants global production efficiency
		-Learn about the Aeoliopile. A peculiar machine that, initially, does not seem to give any benefits, but may in time.
		-Learn about this mysterious substance known as Caeruleum, or Kyanos, as the Greeks referred it as.
-Another new monument, the Great Harbor of Carthage, is constructed as part of conquering Roman Africa. Starting at tier 1, it gives the following modifiers:
	T1: +5 trade power, +100% provincial sailor modifier
	T2: +15 trade power, +100% areal sailor modifier
	T3: +15 trade power, +100% areal sailor modifier, -1% naval tradition decay, +10% trade steering, +1 blockade impact on sieges
-Another new monument, the Basilica of San Vitale, is placed in Ravenna at game start. Starting at tier 1, it gives the following modifiers:
	T1: +0.5 yearly patriarch authority or +50% papal influence from cardinals
	T2: -10% provincial development cost, +0.5 yearly patriarch authority or +50% papal influence from cardinals, +10 relations with heretics
	T3: -30% provincial development cost, +0.5 yearly patriarch authority or +50% papal influence from cardinals, +25 relations with heretics and +1 missionaries
-Another new monument, the Tsarevets Church of Ascension, is placed in Tarnovo at game start (Thanks to Pleibos of Aetas Inventionum for the picture reference). Starting at tier 0 due to its utter sacking by the Ottomans, it gives the following modifiers:
	T1: +1 fort level in province, -0.1 monthly areal devastation
	T2: +1 fort level in province, -0.1 monthly areal devastation, +5% clergy & nobility loyalty modifier
	T3: +1 fort level in province, +1 local dice bonus to defender, +0.1 monthly prosperity growth, -0.1 monthly areal devastation, +5% clergy & nobility loyalty modifier and +2% missionary strength
-A new disaster can now fire for Byzantium: Union of Two Churches, representing the situation after the Council of Florence. It can start firing after the Ottoman threat has been dealt with, i.e, when Byzantium has pushed back from the brink of death.
	-This disaster disables regular conversion of the populace, and relies on religious rebels and event conversions to convert your country.
	-During the disaster, events will pop up spawning orthodox zealots and catholic zealots in a variety of provinces in your realm. The starting setup is 2 orthodox zealot stacks, one in Thrace and one in Morea, and 2 catholic zealot stacks in East/West Macedonia
	-When the disaster fires, Byzantium will swap to Catholic. If Byzantium desires to stay Catholic, it needs to not surrender to Orthodox zealots, while letting the Catholic zealots convert all of Byzantium.
	-If Byzantium desires to stay Orthodox and refute the council of Florence, it needs to defeat all rebels and surrender to Orthodox zealots, while ensuring that no province flips to Catholicism.
	-Finishing this disaster is required for the "A Question of Schismatics" mission, or enter the Age of Reformation without triggering it.
-Three new government reforms for Byzantium:
	-Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, available after finishing the "A Question of Schismatics" mission, which when enacted gives +2% missionary strength against heathens, +1 missionary, as well as a buff to the Religious Culture estate privilege.
	-The Pentarchy, available after finishing the "Restore the Pentarchy" mission, which when enacted gives +2% missionary strength, +1 missionary, as well as a buff to the Religious Culture as well as the Expansionist Zealotry estate privileges
	-United Orthodoxy, available after finishing the "Unite Orthodoxy" mission, which when enacted gives +3% missionary strength, +1 missionary, as well as a buff to the Religious Culture as well as the Expansionist Zealotry estate privileges, while simultaneously removing the loyalty malus of the Clergy from Absolutism.

Tweaks:
-Altered Absolutism to give +2 yearly Pronoiar power and +1 yearly Protostrategos Prominence at 100 absolutism.
-Altered the Nobility estate to give -2 yearly Pronoiar power at max influence if not loyal, double that if disloyal, and half of that if loyal.
-Changed Albion's tag from ABN to ABO because BT added ABN in Horn of Africa
-Completing Court Ideas now increase Exarches loyalty by +5%.
-Reform the Varangian Guard decision is now available with an employed army organizer if you do not have a ruler with a military skill of 5.
-Overhauling the grand KoK:
	-Pronoiars:
		-Hereditary Pronoiar are now renamed as Couropalates
		-Non-hereditary Pronoiars are called Katepanates. 
		-Pronoiar are now only available after reforming the Byzantine monarchy through the mission tree.
		-Mechanically they work similarly to what vanilla implemented, barring mission and event interactions.
	-A lot of mechanics present in King of Kings for Byzantium have been cut entirely, replaced by other mechanics in BR, including Byzantine missions, the startup events, starting modifiers and privileges.
	-Cut holy order tweaks implemented by BR.
	-The Armenian mission tree in BR has been disabled for KoK users.
-Altered the Succession Crisis to stop appearing when the idea "Formalization of Succession Laws" has been picked up.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Antioch/Anatolia/Exarchate of the East not getting Exarchate ideas.
-Fixed Chariot Races event localisation such that, if you move your capital to Rome, the event text will recognise that.
-Fixed Basileus Protostrategos ruler generals getting crap stats because apparently the effect does not use army tradition or ruler skill by default.
-Fixed Arms Training privileges tech swapping for the Generals estate taking new crown land upon swapping from tech.
-Fixed Circus Maximus being buildable when Rome is not the capital.
-Fixed Cimmerian Bosporus event firing when the toll is already there (Created by a prior owner)

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 7.0.4

Bugfixes:
-Fixed error in changelog for BR version 7.0.3 calling "Winds from Beyond the Pale" "Storms Beyond the Pale"
-Fixed Armenia's Conquer Syria mission provinces not being updated.
-Fixed Armenian Georgia chain breaking if Georgia disappears. Now requires you to own one of the Georgian provinces for it to fulfil if Georgia does not exist. The event, just like it did before, will grant permaclaims on the rest of the provinces.
	-Theoretically there might be bugged fringe cases since the effect triggers on the event are different to the mission's new alternate trigger, so do report them if you discover any of them.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 7.0.3

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Winds from Beyond the Pale. 
-Fixed Latin Empire mission tree being broken if you own the Emperor DLC.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 7.0.2

Features:
-Now features Byzantine naming in Mesopotamia.

Tweaks:
-Tweaked the Purchase of Chios event to become the Purchase of the Manoa of Chios and Phocaea, to now better represent the new setup for Genoese Aegean holdings. It now also grants a variable amount of trade power to Genoa in Constantinople depending on whether Genoa holds all these three provinces or not (20 for Chios, 15 for Phocaea and 10 for Samos).

Bugfixes:
-Added the new province of Samos to all missions concerning Chios.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 7.0.1

Features:
-The Storm has subsided, now being activated through a decision.
	-New members from Beyond the Pale have joined the cause!
-Now features Byzantine naming in the Levant.
-Split Byzantine naming for Chios to account for the new Samos province.
	
Tweaks:
-Adjusted Tyrian Purple event regarding Tyros to the province that now actually houses Tyros with the BT15 map update.

Bugfixes:
-Made sure that Beyond the Pale heirs start as immortal.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 7.0.0

Features:
-Updated to BT15
-Armenian, Byzantine & Trebizonder missions have been updated to cope with the new province layout in Mesopotamia & Levant.
-Armenian mission "Expand our Church" now also gives -50% great project cost in Yerevan for 100 years to help with the next mission "Restore Etchmiadzin".
-Added six new estate privileges for the Clergy-Nobility-Burghers trifecta that only activate if BTIP (Internal Politicks) is installed, that intend on fixing the issue of lategame estate loyalty dropping during absolutism, disallowing the revocation of privileges.
-A Storm's a-brewin' from Beyond the Pale...

Tweaks:
-Made the Establish Exarches mission require country to be independent so that Byzantium's permaclaims as a subject don't get too crazy.
-Deleted a file of vanilla's naval doctrines that served no purpose in this mod.
-Due to how Mesopotamia has been set up in BT15, changes have been made to the Armenian tree to give permaclaims on the northernmost part of Mesopotamia (Corduene, Adiabene & Osrhoene) disconnected from the mission to conquer it.
	-This should also help Armenian minors get their much-needed 250 dev to form without having to expand into Ottomans or Mamluks.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Strategoi, Exarches & Knightly Orders not getting influence from crown land share.
-Fixed Trebizond not getting claims on provinces for Safeguard the Balkan Border upon forming Byzantium, yet getting the prerequisite mission autocompleted.
-Fixed several bugs with the Strategoi/Generals estate events that prevented them from firing due to requiring provinces to be owned by the estate, something which is not possible since 1.30.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 6.0.8

Features:
-Added dynamic province naming for Picardy
-If Byzantium falls after Trebizond has completed their "Intermarry with the Palaiologoi" mission, Trebizond gets a permaclaim on Constantinople so they aren't gimped in their mission tree.
-The new Pontus tag has now been made to not spawn if Trebizond exist, much like vanilla does with Greece.
	-In a similar vein, Trebizond has received the same treatment as Byzantium in vanilla, not being able to revolt if Pontus exists.
	-To summarise: If Trebizond exists, Pontic provinces default to Trebizond, or particularists if held by Trebizond. If not, Pontic provinces default to Pontus. Prior to this, Pontic rebels could spawn in Pontic non-Trebizond cores.
-Armenian Resurgence:
	-Armenian Nobles are now known as Nakharars.
	-A chain of 5 generic Apostolic missions mirroring Coptic missions are now available to all Apostolic nations, pointing the nation towards conquering the 5 holy sites of the Apostolic religion.
		-These missions, much like the Coptic missions, have corresponding events that give missionary strength increases in areas close to the holy site, totalling 10 new events for the Apostolic faith. 
		-Further event work may be done at some point for further generic flavour for the Apostolic faith, but that is for a later date.
	-Armenian nations now have a 22 mission-large mission tree in addition to the 5 generic Apostolic ones, featuring:
		-9 conquest missions, giving permaclaims throughout Syria, Mesopotamia, Anatolia and parts of Persia, Caucasia and the Balkans.
		-A 3 mission chain to invite the Bagratids back on the throne, resulting in putting Georgia in a union under Armenia if they still rule in Georgia.
			-This also attempts to rectify the game's Bagratuni-Bagrationi discrepancy causing the game to consider them different dynasties by changing the dynasty to Bagratuni if Armenia is ruled by a Bagrationi.
		-Missions on internal matters such as:
			-Choosing a capital and building it up, granting a Nakharar estate privilege, Nakharar Overseers, that cuts mountain & highlands development costs by -50%.
			-Upgrading The Etchmiadzin Cathedral monument [Leviathan DLC-exclusive], granting a large splendor boost [MoH DLC-exclusive] & clergy loyalty + influence modifier.
			-Forging alliances
			-Developing Armenian culture, inviting Armenians from their diaspora, giving a permanent general cost & advisor cost of primary culture reduction.
			-Fortifying Armenia, granting a permanent -15% shock damage taken modifier.
			-Driving off the Turks, providing a permanent unrest, tax & manpower modifiers for a united religious society & clergy loyalty
			-Converting provinces to the Apostolic faith, giving a culture conversion cost modifier akin to what Byzantium receives for converting Anatolia.
			-Claiming Empire rank, which can be obtained by controlling 4 out of 5 holy sites. If already Empire rank, the mission gives the current ruler extra skill raises.
			-Restoring the Silk Road, which upon completed grants a permanent extra merchant and some trade efficiency.
		-The first few missions only require Armenian culture. To actually get the rest of the mission tree, you need to form Armenia itself. This means forming Armenia now swaps missions.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed a bug with the Create Interregnum effect where it would not kill your heir properly because new patch, sometimes allowing a new heir to spawn in.
-Fixed a bug of Makoraba's revolt_trigger being broken.
-Fixed a bug with the Balkan Princes peacedeal option where the game didn't understand multiple peacedeal options in a single file, resulting in this peacedeal not existing.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 6.0.7

Features:
-Finally added the War of Two Romes CB for the Holy Roman Emperor. If the Emperor gets to enforce its demands in this war, it'll release all nations in the Balkans with a primary culture core and add them to the HRE.
-Added dynamic province naming for Pannonia & Noricum.
-Added more dynamic province naming for France (Everything except Picardy, Barrois & Lorraine areas is now in the game).

Tweaks:
-Cut Absolutism tweaks from the mod as part of me releasing the Internal Politicks addon, relegating the feature to that mod instead.
-Added new BT monument features while simultaneously fixing a few bugs in them.
-Added graphics support for a future estate in my Internal Politicks addon.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed province 7153 being part of Safeguard the Balkan Border, breaking the mission.
-Fixed the mission trigger such that provinces that do not exist in BT any more, yet are still part of province groups, no longer break mission completion.
-Fixed gre_ellenika_provinces showing up on the map because it was missing localisation.
-Fixed bug with province ID 7904 getting 7907's dynamic name.
-Fixed the Treaty of Two Romes not being able to be broken because event was trigger-only.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 6.0.6

Features:
-Added a new monument: Circus Maximus, buildable in Rome if made the Capital of the Empire (Not buildable unless you start a new game due to how the game handles monuments).
	-This allows Chariot Races to continue even if you move your capital to Rome.
	-Building the Circus Maximus can be done by both Byzantium & the Roman Empire, however its modifiers will only be available if Rome is the capital.
	-Due to an extremely similar usage, the monument itself carries similar modifiers to that of the Constantinopolitan Hippodrome, except the legitimacy is replaced by prestige, and the estate loyalty equilibrium at T3 by a great project upgrade cost as well as war exhaustion reduction.
		-The great project upgrade cost will tie in to future monuments that will be unique to Byzantium/Roman Empire, allowing you to restore old Roman arches and other architecture across the Empire.
-De-lagified the Byzantine, Trebizonder & Greek mission trees, based on moving from scripted triggers for a set of provinces over to province groups.
	-While doing that, a lot of outdated script in the mission tree province requirements got fixed, though it was not the source of any bugs.
-Changed BR's estate icons (Generals, Exarches & Knightly Orders) to finally use hands instead of helmets.
-The Greek Fire event has been overhauled for people with Rule Britannia. It now enables the Greek Fire naval doctrine.
	-On the topic of Greek Fire, its modifier has been tweaked from giving +10% siege ability to give +1 naval leader fire.
	-The naval doctrine also carries +10% heavy ship combat ability to compensate for the fact that you have to pay thousand of ducats for the doctrine.

Tweaks:
-Made Exarches cost a diploslot as they were a bit too powerful otherwise.
-Tweaked Large Exarch bonus so that it applies after 40 provinces and 1000 dev instead of 20 provinces and 600 dev.
-Tweaked the Hippodrome of Constantinople so that it requires being in a capital province for its bonuses to apply.
-Tweaked the Chariot events to now support Rome being the capital, with Circus Maximus replacing the Hippodrome of Constantinople for event outcomes purposes.
-Tweaked tolerance to give half as much unrest reduction as unrest spirals towards the lategame as you obtain more tolerance.
-Tweaked Orthodox faith to not give -3 local unrest to Orthodox provinces at 100% patriarch authority. +33% manpower is already huge on top of the other bonuses the religion gives and this should not affect Orthodox's top-tier much.
-Tweaked Nobles, Church, Burghers, Generals & Exarches such that their unhappy maluses got twice as strong, making influential estates be more punishing for Absolutist states.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Valladolid (215) being part of both Tarraconia & Gaelicia mission. Now belongs to Tarraconia.
-Fixed Rusellon (197) not being part of a mission. Now belongs to Narbonnia.
-Slight tweaks to dynamic province naming to avoid duplicate Pergamon introduced in BT14.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 6.0.5

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Theodosian Walls province modifier being available for Leviathan users who also have it as a monument as part of base BT. Unfortunately that monument never becomes ceremonial, but I hope that it will be OK anyway.
-Fixed Chariot Races' good events not giving better rewards for Hippodromes of higher tiers.

Tweaks:
-Altered the Constantinople & Byzantine Empire history file such that it injects data into the Constantinople/Byzantine Empire history files instead of outright replacing them, improving compatibility.
-Tweaked the Latin Empire vassals to get the 1.30 Holy State reform instead of Monastic Order upon being released. If I understand the code correctly, I do not need to modify the reform itself for it to work, but do let me know if this doesn't work.
-Tweaked the Torre del Oro further to provide 0.2/0.3/0.5% yearly army professionalism, in order to fix the UI issue and it still providing way too high army professionalism in BT proper.



###########################################

Byz Resurgence 6.0.4

Features:
-Changed Absolutism to inflict -20% estate loyalty instead of +10 national unrest as part of a potential new BT feature. (Also cut the -5 unrest in trade companies that is meant to offset this unrest)

Tweaks:
-Adjusted Anatolian Restoration mission to require 900 dev (from 750) as Anatolian dev has risen steadily from 593 in BT12 up to 702 in BT14.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed the Hippodrome of Constantinople event to state that, if you have a current construction in the province, you'll be notified when the game will allow you to build the monument.
-Fixed bug with Chariot Races only firing if the Hippodrome of Constantinople was at Tier 1 for Leviathan users.
-Fixed dynamic localisation typo in great plan & not so great plan country modifiers.
-Fixed Rousioi Chariot event accidentally giving double admin point reward.
-Fixed a bug with Clergy & Burghers not giving unrest from being disloyal.
-Fixed Chrysocyon not being very math-y



###########################################

Byz Resurgence 6.0.3

Tweaks:
-Fixed Resurgent Byzantium country modifiers existing on Greek mission tree, replacing them with other modifiers.

Bugfixes:
-Cut the "Can't make state if an Exarch exist in the region" feature of the Exarch system because it caused massive lag upon enacting the Exarch System reform.
-Fixed the Exarch System government reform not cutting Strategoi influence by 10%.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 6.0.2

Tweaks:
-Tweaked Dacian land claims to bear more resemblance to the Roman version plus Moldavia.
-Reduced cost of Varangian guard mercenary companies by 40%.
-Added some minor detail on Exarch independence province triggers to hopefully prefer provinces far away from the capital.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Military Coup disaster missing picture.
-Fixed Lykandos being part of the Crusade for Syria mission instead of the Lesser Armenia mission.
-Fixed a bunch of missing and wrong areas in Western European missions.
-Fixed a bug with Katepanto Ruler where the event that applied it used a single random variable for all provinces. Now the event slowly spreads it through your theme capitals instead.
-Fixed a bug with the Hippodrome events resulting from the game interpreting a great project trigger as always = yes if Leviathan DLC was not activated
-Fixed a bug with event resurgent_BYZ.36 that still checked for a province owned by an estate.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 6.0.1

Features:
-Added a new monument for Leviathan users: The Hippodrome of Constantinople
	-Building it replaces the province modifier that is obtained after dealing with the Triumphial Quadriga questline.
	-The Chariot races event functions the same way as before, except for one difference: Hippodromes at Tier 2 or 3 magnify the positive effects of the chariot races, while keeping the bad effects the same.
	-Modifiers:
		Tier 1: -1 local unrest in Constantinople
		Tier 2: -1 local unrest in area, +0.5 yearly legitimacy
		Tier 3: -1 global unrest, +1 yearly legitimacy, +5% estate loyalty equilibrium
-Created a new Imperial Incident: Byzantine Resurgence. Fires upon Byzantium being independent, not part of the HRE, with at least 1000 development.
	-The Emperor gets the choice to continue the centuries old rivalry, concede Byzantium as the true Romans, or strike a deal.
		-If the Emperor chooses to continue the rivalry, Byzantium gets its War of the Two Romes CB against the Emperor. Simultaneously, the Emperor gets a CB against Byzantium that allows it to release nations that immediately joins the HRE (CB is WIP currently).
		-If the Emperor chooses to concede Byzantium being the true Romans, Imperial Authority drops by 100.
		-If the Emperor chooses to strike a deal, a proposal is sent to Byzantium that they may not conquer any HRE land. In return, the Emperor does not add new land in the Balkans to the HRE.
			-If Byzantium declines this deal, the Emperor continues the rivalry, resulting in the above CBs becoming available.
			-If Byzantium accepts this deal, nothing will happen.
				-If the deal is broken, however, the rivalry will start again, resulting in the above CBs becoming available.
					-Whoever broke the deal loses 20 prestige as well as -2 diplomatic reputation for 25 years.

Tweaks:
-Adjusted Trebizonder missions to be a bit more lenient on their first conquest missions as the setup changed the premise drastically.
-Adjusted No Latins in Greece mission to require, and thus having its mission prerequisite, give cores on the Ionian Islands area.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed two provinces in the Murcia area having wrong IDs assigned to them in province naming, resulting in Andalusian provinces getting wrong names.
-Fixed Latin Imperial duchies not being updated to the new Anatolia setup.
-Fixed BT bug of Latin Empire not getting Emperor DLC Crusader missions.
-Fixed BT bug of Greece not getting the new missions.
-Cut unnecessary dependencies from the BT13 era.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 6.0.0

Features:
-Updated to Beyond Typus version 14 for 1.32, including support for BT14's new features.
-Updated localised naming for all of Iberia & South-Southeast France. The areas that have been done now have dynamic capital and province names. Only northern+central France as well as Belgia, Germania, Rhaetia & Britannia left.
-Cede Exarch Lands decisions now feature a province highlight that shows what provinces will be ceded to the Exarchate the decision concerns.
-Created a Greek mission tree. 
	-Being heavily centered around the Megali Idea and that the Greek nation in EU4 is centered around a tall state centered around the Aegean Sea, it plays more on internal affairs instead of pure conquest.
	-The mission tree itself is made out of 7 conquest missions & 6 internal missions, as well as featuring two mission flavour events and several new mission modifiers & features.
-Added new mission pictures to accomodate for the Greek mission tree.
-Added a new Pontic tag: Pontus. Eventually this will hopefully replace Trebizond as the Pontic Greek primary tag in BT proper, but it was added here for now as part of the Greek mission tree.
-Added a Turkic Cavalry mercenary company to the Byzantine mission tree, should Byzantium integrate the Turks into society instead of culturally genociding them. 
	-This mercenary company consists of almost solely cavalry units, with a large buff to cavalry support limit which should prevent the insufficient support modifier from triggering in theory.
	-It also uses Turkish/Ottoman unit graphics.

Tweaks:
-Renamed a Trebizonder mission to Komnenian Restoration instead of Restore the Empire.
-Made it so that Catholic Byzantium need not control Rome in order to restore its Roman Imperial name. It still needs to be Catholic, however.
-Tweaked Byzantine government reforms so that only Byzantine tags can access it. This means Byzantium, Trebizond & Cappadocia, plus the Exarches. Greece & Pontus should now be excluded from it.
-Tweaked Fall of Constantinople? event chain to instead of providing an alliance with Byzantium to instead make Aragon join Byzantium's defensive wars (New 1.30 effect).
-Made some events not considered major events such as Byzantium or Trebizond purchasing islands from Genoa. Why they were in the first place, I have no idea.

Bugfixes:
-Added Generals & Exarch seize land rebels.
-Fixed province 2447 not being included in event resurgent_BYZ.2
-Fixed bug in Byzantine mission Bastion of Christendom where it would highlight provinces that were Orthodox, not your faith.
-Fixed Military General & Provincial Governor advisors not spawning after enabling their respective estate privileges.
-Fixed erroneous province tags in assigning random development in missions.
-Fixed Question of Schismatics mission not autocompleting for a nation forming Byzantium.
-Fixed estate UI change from 1.30.6 causing crashes in newer versions.
-Fixed Latin Empire formation decision being broken. Apparently old "government = X" that checked for pre-govreform government types break everything now.
-Fixed subject country formations not inheriting the user's religion, leading to Catholic Byzantium releasing Orthodox Exarches and similar things.
-Fixed Strategoi estate privilege Flintlock Musket Training erroneously being localised as Pike Formation Training.

Known issues:
-Latin Empire duchies in Anatolia have not been adapted to the new province setup. Will get to it eventually.


###########################################

Byz Resurgence 5.0.7

Tweaks:
-Adjusted Gallipoli mission reward to give +30 separatism instead of +20, which translates into +15 unrest instead of +10, counting down by -0.5/year.

Bugfixes:
-Having the Succession Crisis disaster cleared now actually removes the Succession Crisis modifier from your nation.
-Finally fixed the Military Parades mechanic.
-Fixed Generals Estate disaster missing an icon.
-Clarified the Theme Capital tooltip that it does not include capital provinces for the purposes of Theme Capital count.
-Fixed Morea not being able to reform Byzantium due to the endgame tag trigger. Also cleaned up the decision to look a bit nicer.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 5.0.6

Features:
-The Exarchates now have proper monarch lists with regnal numbers following history instead of Byzantium's.

Tweaks:
-Adjusted Military Coup and Exarch Independence disasters to tick like 1.30 estate disasters and not like 1.29 estate disasters.
-Attempted to clarify the Strategoi Theme Capital/Themata mechanic a bit better through the government reform description as nobody seems to read estate descriptions.
-Moved some BR-specific tags for use in the SE start in BT.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Revoke Exarch Autonomy gov reform revoking itself upon being enacted.
-Fixed having 10 or more generals completely removing the scaling influence modifier for the Strategoi estate.
-Fixed missing devdoubling in Large Exarch bonus.
-Fixed Loss of Constantinople event firing if Morea exists.
-Fixed a bug where apparently not having a flag set was used in localisation for the Varangian Guard mercenary companies.
-Fixed Cibyrraeum not having a flag.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 5.0.5

Features:
-Added revolutionary colours for Byzantium & Trebizond

Bugfixes:
-Fixed missing localisation that accidentally got commented out in version 5.0.4.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 5.0.4

Features:
-Finally added Exarches estate privileges. Note that these were difficult to balance due to the fact that they are a post-Absolutism estate where you want to have as much crown land as possible. The privileges are:
	-Exarch Land Rights (Much like every other estate's gov capacity privilege, however is slightly stronger due to the above factor and that governing is their specialty)
	-Integrated Viceroys: Scalable to crown land +20% admin efficiency. Costs 5% crown land, -5% Exarches loyalty equilibrium, -10 absolutism and gives +10% Exarches influence.
	-Appoint new Exarch: Gives 5% of crown land to the Exarches and immediately revokes the privilege afterwards, meaning you get to control how much land you give them.
	-Dynastic Exarches: Gives +50% Heir Chance, but +0.1 yearly corruption. +5% Exarches loyalty equilibrium, -5 absolutism and +10% Exarches influence. Makes Exarch pretender rebels always be your dynasty.
	-Autonomous Exarches: Gives +25% minimum autonomy floor. +10% Exarches loyalty equilibrium, -5 absolutism and +10% Exarches influence.
	-Exarches Court Advisors: -5% Nobility influence, -5 absolutism, +10% Generals influence. Allows the generation of Provincial Governor advisors.
-Added a new Generals/Strategoi privilege: Strategoi Court Advisors. -5% Nobility influence, +10% Generals loyalty, +10% Generals influence. Allows the generation of Military General advisors.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Land Access to Italy mission requiring an English province, something the Basileus does not have the ambition to conquer just yet.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 5.0.3

Features:
-Finally added factions loyalty modifiers to the Byzantine Bureaucracy factions!
	-Army tradition gives scaling +0.1 influence to the Domestikoi
	-Stability gives 0.05 influence to the Sakellarioi per point (Goes both negative and positive)
	-Prestige gives scaling +0.1 influence to the Magistroi
	-Being at war gives +0.1 influence to the Domestikoi
	-Being at peace gives +0.1 influence to the Magistroi
-Added three new estate privileges for the Generals/Strategoi concerning generals training, giving them something that equates to monthly monarch point privileges.

Tweaks:
-Added historical rivalry between Ottomans and Morea if formed by Byzantium through the Fall of Constantinople event to prevent the situation where Morea would sit on Lemnos for the rest of the game.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed the Military Parades event being broken, with the on_action checking for the invalid estate_strategoi.31 event ID.
-Fixed prestige and corruption not giving Generals and Exarches loyalty equilibrium.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 5.0.2

Features:
-The Exarch System and Revoke Exarch Autonomy are now T6 and T7 government reforms instead of decisions since the Government reforms are now part of the basegame.
	The Exarch System has the same modifiers as before: +500 governing capacity and -20 absolutism. This means you lose an extra +500 governing capacity in total.
	Revoke Exarch Autonomy requires 65 absolutism, which will require a fair bit of work to obtain in 1.30, especially with the above modifier being in effect.
		It also now carries +10 absolutism and +1 yearly absolutism, adapted from the Political Absolutism reform in the same tier.
-Updated Dynamic Province Names in the entirety of Balkans and Lesser Armenia.
-Managed to squeeze the Estates view so that it can display up to 7 estates + crown land in the crown land share list (If anybody knows how to add a gridbox slider, I'd love to know).
-Started work on Exarch estate privileges (Only land privileges added so far, missing localisation. Will be fixed next update).

Tweaks:
-Rebalances the Basileus Protostrategos reform due to new Miltiarisation mechanics.
	-Added a -50% governing capacity modifier
	-Made it Rights of Man exclusive since it made no sense to have it due to the governing capacity malus otherwise.
	-Buffed monarch military skill from 2 to 3
	-Tweaked absolutism gain from +5 to +10
-Drastically reduced pacify option manpower cost for Chariot Race revolt events due to 1.30 massively reducing rebel sizes (A 90k rebel stack is now 35ish-k)

Misc:
-Adjusted the Static modifiers file to work better with BT's (And other mods') changes.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Reclaim Anatolia mission still using DLC check for government reforms.
-Fixed new province Pettau being part of the Raetia & Noricum mission instead of Land Access to Italy.
-Fixed East Oriental Schism event not firing from mission if completed through subjects owning the province.
-Fixed more things still checking for the old modifier versions of the Theme System government reform.
-Fixed Generals' province modifiers from privileges not being applied on new Theme capitals.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 5.0.1

Features:
-The Succession Crisis events that allow you to accept a pretender now has a tooltip stating that you cannot accept any other pretenders.
-Also removed all "The Cream will rise to the top" generic option names.
-Adjusted dynamic province names to include cities in Anatolia.

Tweaks:
-Adjusted Strategoi theme capital requirements of 10/20/30/40 up to 15/30/45/60 due to not being state-locked any more.
-Adjusted what counts as a Theme Capital for the Strategoi. Now it only requires a fort and a regimental camp (An actual regimental camp this time).
-Adjusted Strategoi Privileges so they actually state how many Theme Capitals you currently have. They have also been unhidden, with requirements being moved to the trigger.

Bugfixes:
-Varangan Guard mercs and tooltip now has localisation.
-Fixed event check in purple_phoenix checking for now deprecated legacy governments.
-Fixed LTE missions overlapping with Emperor missions.
-Fixed some issues with regards to Cibyrraeum (Was CBR, now CBT) not being entirely tag-changed due to a vanilla 1.30 tag being added.
-Fixed Basileus Protostrategos being lost if the monarch is no longer a general (Which could happen in the case of a regency).
-Event estate_strategoi.31 now has localisation.
-Fixed broken characters in localisation for integrated_byz_events.48
-Fixed rogue '[' in dynamic province names.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 5.0

Features:
-Updated Byzantine government reforms to work with the new estates. The Theme System reform is now special in that it cedes 10% Nobility land, 5% Burghers and 5% Crown land to the Strategoi.
-Added a new Varangian Guard mercenary company. This mercenary company is costly, but has some rather large military buffs to it. The mod features both a regular and an elite version.
-Overhauled the Byzantine-unique estates. Exarches and Knightly Orders lack privileges, and all three lack agendas, which I'll probably add at a later date.
-Added Strategoi/Generals privileges:
	-Grant Land Rights: Exchange crown lands for 200 governing capacity.
	-Autonomous Defences: Grant the Strategoi more autonomy in managing their defenses, giving Theme Capitals more defensiveness and garrison growth.
	-Increased Army Settlement: Exchange crown lands for a scaled manpower and tax boost.
	-Katepano Promotion: Promotes 20% of all Theme Capital Strategoi to Katepano, giving a massive manpower boost in those provinces in exchange for less tax income. Also provides +10% morale of armies.
	-Military Parades: Restore the Military Parades of old! Upon winning a war, gain +5 Army Tradition. Your Generals will parade in your capital, granting reduced unrest. Also reduces army tradition decay by 0.5%.
	
-Byzantine Roman Empire formation now does not change your tag, only your display name, to "Roman Empire".


Tweaks:
-Heavily tweaked the Byzantine formation decision to now require 75 out of the 121 eligible provinces, so a resurgent Greece cannot form it as easily (30 provinces was less than modern Greece).
-Lots of changes to internal files as part of updating to the 1.30 patch and BT 13.


###########################################

Byz Resurgence 4.0.12

Features:
-Added an option to spend manpower to prevent rebels from rising up in Constantinople from the Chariot Races events.

Tweaks:
-Adjusted Galatia's main capital to be Bourdigala and not Treberon, as it blocked the player from stating provinces in North Germany instead of France as intended.
-Added province highlighting to Reclaim Anatolia mission to highlight tags of Turkish culture, since people don't understand AQ is Turkish culture.

Bugfixes:
-Locked some splendor and quite possibly prosperity gains in missions behind the Mandate of Heaven DLC as Splendor & Prosperity are DLC mechanics.
-Fixed Conquer Arabia mission overlapping with the Conquer Palestine mission.
-Fixed BT Bugfixes overwriting BR's on_actions.
-Fixed missing localisation for some Latin mission descriptions.
-Fixed all Exarch-related tags being able to revolt in their respective cultures before formation (E.g Makoraba in Petronium, Ravenna in Italy, etc.)

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 4.0.11

Features:
-Properly implemented a Latin Empire mission tree. This one is similar to the Byzantine tree in that it takes you all around the Roman Empire. The tree is however much smaller and may receive diversification later down the line.
-Adjusted the Knightly Orders Autonomy revocation decision to settle the knightly orders in the province and as a result, convert the province to the knightly order's primary culture. This is to allow a bit of customisation for a mission in the Latin mission tree.
-Added the Patriarchate of Mecca & Medina, a releasable nation for Byzantium through an event given as part of the Patriarch of Mecca & Medina decision, similar to the Mughal Deccan viceroyalty event.

Tweaks:
-Adjusted some decisions concerning Byzantium that required the Byzantine idea set despite not requiring a particular idea from their idea set.
-Fixed some inconsistencies with Byzantine naming of ships.
-Moved Latin Empire mission scripted triggers into a main file, renaming it to br_mission_triggers

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Trebizonder Lesser Armenia claims being broken due to the change last patch.
-Fixed Cujik province (8017) not being part of the Rhenus border mission and associated bugs with it not being in the trigger.
-Fixed Latin Empire revoke Knightly Orders Autonomy decision erroneously stating you require between 65 and 70 Latin Imperial Authority.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 4.0.10

Features:
-Started work on Greek naming for new provinces in Iberia. Aragon, Andalusia, Extremadura & South Portugal is currently done.

Tweaks:
-Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Muslim version now activates if Ottomans keep the Patriarchate in one of their flavour events.
-Updated Trebizonder missions to use the new mission claim/core scripted effect.
-Gave Raise Tourma Strategoi interaction a custom tooltip to avoid tooltip bloat.
-Tweaked Tyrian Purple event to increase Silk price by 15%, up from 10%, and depletion event to decrease by -25%, up from -10%.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Byzantine Resurgence Anatolia CB not activating if Ottomans owned parts of Wallachia.
-Fixed only requiring 1k dev to pass emperor & autocrat of the Romans.
-Fixed War of Two Romes giving twice the intended AE (30) and Prestige (50). Seems like BT doubled this somehow, or it being some other edge case bug I have no idea how to fix.
-Fixed minor localisation bugs.
-Fixed drafting Dacia or Alania from a subject resulting in a situation where they would keep their previous capital and not move to the new one.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 4.0.9

Features:
-Added two new missions to the Byzantine mission tree:
	-Fortify Armenia: Build at least 4 forts of fort level 2 in Lesser Armenia. Awards a defensiveness buff and +2 base manpower to those fort provinces.
	-Restore Armenia: Own 300 development worth of Armenian-cultured provinces and accept Armenian. Awards Armenian Auxillaries, giving +0.25 Infantry Shock until the end of the game.

Tweaks:
-Minor tweak to the descriptor file to put the BT Addon Dynamic Province Names as a dependency, allowing Byzantine naming in this mod to pass through BT's otherwise erroneous naming.
-Removed deprecated BT and BR on_actions as a result of work in BT Bugfixes.
-Tweaked the mission coding syntax by adding scripted effects for claims in order to require less scripting in the file (Byz tree shrunk by 12%).
-Tweaked decision to integrate Exarches & Knightly Orders to show up before the ages where absolutism is available.
-Tweaked Anatolian Restoration mission to use new 1.29 development_in_provinces trigger. Instead of requiring 20 provinces to be developed 5 times, it now requires 750 owned development in Anatolia.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed some triggers not checking for dev-doubled numbers on vassalisation CBs from missions.
-Fixed new 1.29 triggered modifiers concerning China not applying since BR had to overwrite the pentarchy trigmod.

###########################################


Byz Resurgence 4.0.8

Tweaks:
-Deprecated the Russian arty fix since 1.29 apparently fixed Russia's army composition incompetency.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Dacia's highlighting and claims to be updated.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 4.0.7

Tweaks:
-Adjusted the Culture Creole event to check for adm points instead of dip points, because the event-triggered culture conversion effect uses admin points instead of diplo points. Maybe an artifact from the early days?

Misc:
-Fixed BT Bugfixes not being a dependency

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 4.0.6

Tweaks:
-Rebalanced Exarch modifiers to make it a bit more valuable to revoke the Exarch autonomy:
	-Exarch Territory modifier has been lowered to 20% autonomy floor.
	-Exarch capital modifier has been adjusted from 3/5/8 max states at 10/20/30 dev to 4/9/18 states at 20/40/60 dev since regions have grown larger and areas are more plentiful.
-Adjusted the Culture Creole events:
	-Instead of instantly converting the culture, it starts a culture conversion by the Exarch state. 
	-Event triggers have been adjusted to be the same as when the province can be culture-converted.
	-The event is hidden and fires more frequently.
	-To avoid point-starving of the Exarches, the event will not fire if the Exarch has less than 100 dip.
	-Removed the 2nd event as it was made to counterbalance the instant conversions.
-Tweaked pretender rebel stack composition down to 30% cav due to Misc adjusting cavalry support limits down to 30% from 50%, something now fixed in BT Bugfixes.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed extra quote marks on Subjugate the Pope claims string.
-Fixed Rebellious Demetrios event not firing due to a missing flag that was removed in the integrated Byzantine events toggle removal.
-Fixed a bug that hid two Exarches estate interactions due to requiring an outdated government type.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 4.0.5

Tweaks:
-Adjusted the Latin Empire release mechanic to not require Constantinople to be in a state. It also now gives cores to the whole Thrace area if you are to release the Latin Empire.
-Adjusted dependencies of Byzantine Resurgence to have my BT Bugfixing mod as one to prevent overwriting the Mount Athos province modifier in Chalcidice.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Fall of Constantinople? event not requiring Aragon to not rival Byzantium, which the follow-up event does.
-Bugfixed the event for Sufi shrine removal where it didn't set the shrine left alone flag to the province that it triggered for.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 4.0.4

Features:
-Added some stray Greek localised naming for Arabia & India.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed EPR being unlocalised.
-Fixed Knightly Order description not supporting dynamic localisation keys.
-Fixed a bunch of mismatches on the tooltip of how Latin Imperial Authority is calculated.


###########################################

Byz Resurgence 4.0.3

Bugfixes:
-Fixed broken localisation on government reform tweaks.
-Fixed edge-case Demetrios Palaiologos bug where Demetrios could spawn for Byzantium even if they didn't own Selymbria.
-Fixed a bug with the disconnected Byzantine cores from 4.0.2

Tweaks:
-Removed 50 absolutism requirement for reduce exarch autonomy decision to appear and moved requirement for an exarch to exist to the potential instead.
-Basileus Protostrategos requires ruler general to be enacted.
-Tweaked some localisation strings for missions that were either poorly written or just downright incorrect.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 4.0.2

Bugfixes:
-Fixed the Chariot races event being able to fire more than once at a time if you let the event stay up for a long time.
-Fixed BT bug with disconnected Byzantine cores.

Tweaks:
-Adjusted Exarchate government reform & legacy government to have -5 accepted culture slots, thus resulting in situations where your Exarches cannot accept cultures, only convert them.
-Tweaked government reforms to use reform mechanics like what Governments Expanded uses.
-Tweaked chariot race events to be less punishing on the rebel front, reducing the rebel size after having seen 100+k pretender rebels spawn in Constantinople.
-Additionally, bonuses granted from the chariot races have been buffed.
-Adjusted Constantinople Recovers BT event to require your own religion and not specifically Orthodox. Also upped the dev bonus since the event has been neglected since dev doubling.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 4.0.1

Features:

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Genoa's special-case event where Genoese ruler is an Entrepreneur, in which Byzantium does not get Chios, despite losing their money.
-Also fixed a similar issue in Trebizond's purchase of Amastris.
-Fixed a tooltip error in the Tyrian Purple event.
-Added a failsafe for resurgent_BYZ.7 where the event sometimes fires for Byzantium even if they control Constantinople.
-Fixed the load order shenanigans because of the new Beyond Typus workshop mod.


Tweaks:
-Tweaked Exarches liberty desire to even lower values per development point.
-Re-added the slim chance of the Ottomans still declaring on Byzantium even if they are allied to one of Ottoman's rivals (Pretty sure I disabled it just to test the trigger at one point and forgot to re-add it).

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 4.0

Features:
-Updated mission triggers plus startup screen to 1.29.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 3.2.4.5

Features:
-Added two new Knightly Order estate interactions in a further attempt to complete the estate. Still missing and need ideas for:
	- A colonial interaction
	- One or two more interactions
	- Estate events (Conflicts with nobility, clergy & burghers, disloyalty events, etc.)
	- Estate disaster (Likely forcing independence)

Bugfixes:
-Fixed some missing stuff from Miscellanea's estates rebalancing.
-Fixed broken localisation with Byzantine Bureaucracy
-Added missing localisation for Knightly Orders
-Fixed Knightly Orders having wrong icon
-Fixed some other minor bugs with the Knightly Orders

Tweaks:
-Adjusted the Theme System province highlighter to only highlight provinces if you do not meet the requirements of owning 100 provinces in Balkans+Anatolia.
-Adjusted the conversion missions in Anatolia to allow for a trigger that uses the same scripted trigger.
-Adjusted the Bastion of Christendom Byzantine mission to also be triggered if you are catholic, papal controller, and the crusade target is Muslim.

###########################################


Byz Resurgence 3.2.4.4

Tweaks:
-Adjusted some Latin Empire orders from easterngfx to westerngfx.
-Added Trebizonder country colours to interface better with the new BR Unit Pack update making units dynamic, and to allow the unit pack to avoid changing the checksum for MP compatibility.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 3.2.4.3

Bugfixes:
-City of the World's Desire event was bugged once again and has now been fixed.
-Fixed Trebizond having completed Restore the Empire mission not getting permaclaims on Foothold in Italy provinces.
-Fixed some outdated estate files.
-Fixed and added some minor Greek province naming.
-Potential fix for the Succession Crisis not firing during a regency council. Seems that the disaster would disable and enable every monthly tick.
-Fixed duplicate Pentarchy & Catholic Rome modifiers, at the expense of disabling mod compatibility with any mod that adjusts triggered modifiers.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 3.2.4.2

Bugfixes:
-More bugfixes with Trebizonder mission tree.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 3.2.4.1

Bugfixes:
-Fixed at least 4 different bugs with the Trebizonder mission tree.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 3.2.4

Bugfixes:
-Fixed broken highlighting for missions Pentarchy & East Oriental Schism
-Fixed non-updated mil-tech file to include Miscellanea's new ahead of time bonuses.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 3.2.3

Bugfixes:
-Fixed 5 out of 6 faction events being broken since Dharma.
-Fixed Holy Byzantine Empire granting Imperial Princes' lands to the Holy Roman Empire instead of the Roman Empire.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 3.2.2

Features:
-Added more Greek province names to the Balkans
-Adjusted Holy Orders such that all Catholic nations can use them, meaning Catholicism gets a slight buff compared to other Christian denominations.
-Also adjusted the Andalusian Holy Orders so that any Sunni nation gets access to them. Considering some of them even had presence in India, I believe this is fair.
-Added support for triggered modifiers for when your subjects control the holy cities of Rome, Jerusalem and Mecca, giving you the same modifiers as your subjects get.
	-These are not specific to Byzantium either, but rather are allowed for anyone currently controlling them.
	-These triggered modifiers are currently commented in a file, so if you wish to enable them, find 02_byz_resurgence_compensation_triggered_modifiers.txt and uncomment them.

Tweaks:
-Adjusted the Pentarchy modifier to not require you to own the provinces directly, however they must be Orthodox religion.
-Removed the Byzantine startup event, finally removing the mess that was the unintegrated Byzantium Events by Nevik at this point.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Byzantium being formable by end-game tags.
-Fixed a bug where province 141 had no name.
-Removed Ottoman claims to both Thrace areas since one was deprecated in BT 11.5
-Fixed Foothold in Italy not being part of the Exarchate of Ravenna provinces.
-Fixed a tag conflict between the Ravennan Exarchate and the trade city of Ravenna, with them using the same country file. Hopefully this doesn't break savegames.
-Fixed Orhan being of no culture and no religion.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 3.2.1

Bugfixes:
-Fixed Gotland not starting as a pirate republic.
-Fixed Subjugate Serbia mission requiring a dutch province instead of Belgrade/Singidon.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 3.2

Features:
-Updated missions and Latin Empire duchies for BT 11.5's new areas and provinces.
-Minor updated naming for BT 11.5's balkans (More will come later)
-Made some Byzantine government reforms available to Republic Byzantium/Rome, to allow for Theme System restoration under the Republic, however weird that may initially seem.
	-Sadly, this increases incompatibility with any mod that attempts to add government reforms at all.
-Added Trebizonder missions, sending them to conquer Anatolia, Cherson & Byzantium itself.
	-The missions also include the ceding of Amastris to Trebizond as part of another trade deal, similar to the event granted to Byzantium for Chios.
	-Depending on what missions have been completed, certain Byzantine missions will auto-complete upon forming Byzantium.
-The Latin Imperial Authority modifier now shows the exact values for what increases and decreases Latin Imperial Authority, in addition to showing monthly gain and total.

Tweaks:
-Adjusted byz_chariot_race_events.3 to spawn peasants instead of particularists
-Adjusted Byzantium formation requirements to better fit potential claimants, such as Trebizond with their new mission tree.
-Removed BT bugfixes because they've now been fixed in BT proper. #Only Moroccan ideas fix left
-Adjusted Theodoro and all references to them as 'of Gothia' to properly reference them as the Gabras dynasty, as they historically was.
-Adjusted Exarch LD gain from development down to 0.15 from 0.25 and base liberty desire to 0%, down from -25%.
	-This is an attempt at making it so that Exarches can control huge amounts of dev without going rebellious. A 3k+ development Galatia is impossible to get below 50% LD.

Bugfixes:
-Byzantine Succession Crisis can no longer fire if Byzantium is a republic.
-Fixed missing claims in the Trentino area.
-Fixed Bonifacio's dynamic name being used for non-existent province 6038 instead of its actual 7038 ID.
-Attempted bugfix with the Succession Crisis randomly giving you one of your royal marriaged countries' dynasty upon accepting foreign rulers.
-Fixed Thessaly highlighting Chersonese provinces.
-Fixed granting Exarch lands giving free cores even if Byzantium lacked cores on them, and also disabled it during wartime. Also cleaned up their tooltip.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 3.1.5.2

Bugfixes:
-Fixed a bug that prevented the City of the World's Desire event to fire.
-Fixed 1.28 startup screens missing from BR.
-Fixed BT bug of beer price change events not firing.
-Fixed BT bug of Pittich spreading all over the world.

###########################################

Byz Resurgence 3.1.5.1

Tweaks:
-Adjusted LD gain from granting provinces to match the new values introduced in the last hotfix.
-Fixed and adjusted some Byzantine names in North Africa.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed the BT bug of Moroccan ideas being doubled, restoring the previous values intended for them.




############################################

Byz Resurgence 3.1.5

Features:
-Finalised localised naming for Italy.

Bugfixes:
-Added hidden immediate effect to resurgent_BYZ.3
-Fixed some BT bugs with regards to subject liberty desire.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 3.1.4.1

Bugfixes:
-Fixed only the Karchidon Exarch having its "ai=yes" trigger removed.
-Fixed the culture conversion event being broken since Dharma because of an old government check trigger.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 3.1.4

Features:
-Finally added the Chariot Races event:
	The Chariot Races are quadrennial, i.e, they fire once every 4 years, once the Triumphial Quadriga has been returned to Constantinople and the Hippodrome has been reconstructed. 
	During each race, the game randomly chooses between 13 different outcomes for the races, slightly weighted towards different outcomes for gameplay or historical reasons.
	Example gains could be that a particular faction wins, granting monarch points and certain estate influence, or a global unrest reduction from a favourite candidate winning.
	Eventually this'll be extended to be replaced by Olympic Games when embracing the Enlightenment, but this feature is yet to be implemented.
-Adjusted the AI cede events for Exarches to now appear in-game. Reason being is I figured out how to emulate the LD province gain modifier.
	Note that BT has yet to lower the LD gain from granting provinces to a vassal, despite the dev doubling. Thus, this uses vanilla values for now.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed roman culture not being able to pick up the Byzantine Government Reforms
-Fixed Exarchates not getting Exarchate government reform. This was due to the government reform changing just before they became an Exarch subject.


############################################

Byz Resurgence 3.1.3

Features:
-Added a Resettle Gallipoli modifier to the Byzantine mission "Deny Ottomans Access"
-Added a 3-mission large Latin Minors mission tree.

Tweaks:
-Adjusted the first two Byzantine conquest of Greece missions to still fulfil if Ottomans do not control any lands in the Balkans. 
	Reason being that I noticed the AI being way too derpy as it usually has alliances taking Ottoman provinces in the region, meaning the whole mission tree gets locked behind it.
-Adjusted missions giving subjugation CBs to check for 200 development instead of 100.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed the pretenders.txt file being outdated since before Dharma.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 3.1.2

Features:
-Added naming for the new provinces in the Histria-Venetia area, Sardinia-Corsica, southern Piedmont, plus some missing names in other regions.


Tweaks:
-Adjusted the Russia Arty buff to come into effect at tech 7 already.
-Merged the effects of the Pentarchy decision into the mission, while leaving the decision for non-Byzantium players so others can also restore the Pentarchy.
-Also added a new mission to make the East-Oriental Schism functioning the same way. Also moved the Unite Orthodoxy mission to create symmetry.
-Fixed some issues with Catholic Byzantium not being able to get Tyrian Purple events.

Bugfixes:
-Actually made the Ottomans out of Greece mission grant permanent claims for the mission Recover West Anatolia, as stated by the localisation.
-Fixed a missing localisation that occured due to deleting unnecessary localisation strings accidentally slipping in a used line.
-Fixed a potential issue with government reforms if having Golden Century installed.
-Adjusted the 100 dev mark for Catholic/Coptic nations to convert to Orthodox to 200 to account for the dev doubling done in BT.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 3.1.1

############################################

Byz Resurgence 3.1

New computer means some WIP features are now lost. I may manage to reclaim them eventually, but basically this version is based off the 3.0.7 workshop version.
Also, some developer notes: I do not know how to fix the Succession Crisis being able to start but will not tick up during regency.

Features:
-Updated to patch 1.28 properly
-Updated localised naming for new 1.28 provinces
-Continued work on Italian Byzantine province names (Still not done, Lombardy, Piedmont and Venetia are left).

Tweaks:
-Upped Succession Crisis number of provinces required to start up to 15.
-Did a quick band-aid fix and readjusted Constantinople's trade good back to cloth, once more allowing the Constantinopolitan manufactories event to fire.
-Deprecated the Russian Arty Buff events as Reddit reports Russia actually producing artillery now.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed the Burghers' admiral estate interaction being broken.
-Fixed all references to centers of trade from pre-1.27

Misc:
-Removed a bunch of leftover Latin Empire files since Draiocht added them to BT proper


############################################

- Fixed the releasing of Dacia & Alania ending up with nogovernmentname and norulertitle.

- Changed some mission icons about.


############################################

Byz Resurgence 3.0.6

Features:
- Byzantine Parliament is now known as the Senate.
- Made Demetrios Palaiologos now properly spawn in Selymbria, as the description seems to hint at. Also prevents some AI derping.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed the Subjugate the Pope mission not granting any claims, and the Greater Greece mission granting claims to Central italy instead of the Pope mission.
- Remedied the claims of Dacia to include the new provinces in Moldavia. Also moved some others around.
- Fixed some claims of the Alania march as well.
- Attempted fix at the norulertitle nogovernmentname bug that seemingly pops up for Alania by changing them into a monarchy at game start instead of a tribal federation.
- Fixed the fort levels of the walls modifiers being broken by removing them outright again.
- Fixed Exarches of Antioch & Alexandria not getting Exarchate ideas.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 3.0.5

Bugfixes:
- Fixed the Roman Empire formation decision being gone completely as a result of attempting to fix the formation decision disappearing as non-orthodox.
- Fixed the issue of Latin Empire being released with no government.
- Fixed the issue of Byzantium tagswitching into Morea getting no government.
- Fixed the issue of being unable to establish Dacia & Alania if you had the Dharma DLC.

Tweaks:

- Added +0.1 monthly militarisation to the Domestikoi faction.
- Added +0.03 monthly militarisation to each province controlled by a loyal Strategoi estate.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 3.0.4

Features:
- Did some major updating on the Latin Empire's subjects' files.
- Added two new Knightly Orders: Thessaly and Macedonia, bringing the total up to 35.
- Overhauled the Latin Empire's subject liberty desire into a brand new mechanic: Latin Imperial Authority.
	- Upon forming the Latin Empire, you now get a country modifier that shows you your current Latin Imperial Authority. It also shows the monthly change.
	- Latin Imperial Authority affects mainly your subjects.
		- If below 50, it increases their liberty desire.
		- If above 50, it decreases their liberty desire, while also boosting their stats, meaning you get more troops to throw at your enemies.
		- Latin Imperial Authority increases for each Knightly Order that is loyal, as well as with high legitimacy and absolutism.
		- It decreases for each province owned by you, as well as each province owned by your Knightly Orders (Albeit by much less than your own provinces).
		- The modifier ticks monthly through a hidden event.
	- Upon reaching 100 Latin Imperial Authority, you can integrate your Knightly Orders by the start of the Age of Absolutism.


Bugfixes:
- Fixed the Roman Empire formation decision disappearing if you're not orthodox to requiring you to just be Christian instead.
- 'Fixed' the bug of Militarisation appearing on top of the Iqta mechanic in the Government screen by making Pronoiar and Basileus Protostrategos mutually exclusive (Sorry, no proper way of fixing this unless I jumble with the whole interface).
- Fixed a bug with the Latin Knightly Orders being assigned as monarchies.
- Fixed the core not disappearing on a Knightly Order's capital.
- Fixed event resurgent_BYZ.13 (Hippodrome of Constantinople) missing localisation if Venice has not been chastened (Accidentally had written 'da' instead of 'db' in localisation).
- Fixed Exarch tags being granted non-existing reforms upon their creation.
- Fixed Purple Phoenix faction events not firing for Dharma owners.
- Fixed reforms and legacy government giving local goods produced instead of global goods produced modifier.

Tweaks:
- Thracesium Knightly Order now renamed to Philadelphia, to show off the historical planned duchy (And the now existing city in BT 10.0) granted to Stephen of Perche before he died in the Battle of Adrianople in 1205. They also get a new flag and crusader unit if you use my unit pack, as well.
- Moved the Mount Athos modifier to the new Chalcidice province to better reflect its location. While whoever controlled Thessalonica technically also controlled the monks' allegiance, it's better to have it in the region.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 3.0.3

Features:
- Made Naples able to form the Latin Empire, as they were historically ruled by the Anjous.
- Re-added the Hexamilion Wall event as BT now represents Corinth.
- Byzantium (Or anyone of hellenic or roman culture) now has unique government reforms:
	- Pronoiar: Tier 2. -0.1 global autonomy. Enables Iqta mechanics for Cradle of Civilisation owners. -10% Nobility influence, -20% Nobility loyalty.
	- Roman Bureaucracy: Tier 3. +10% national tax modifier, +10% goods produced modifier, enables Byzantine factions.
	- Theme System: Tier 4. +25% land forcelimit modifier, -10% Nobility influence. Enables the Strategoi estate.
	- Basileus Protostrategos: Tier 5. +2 Monarch military skill, +20% Strategoi loyalty. Enables Militarisation. Forces the monarch to become a general upon succeeding to the throne.
- Non-Dharma owners will get access to all the above except the Basileus Protostrategos mechanic through either decisions (Existing in the mod previously), or as part of the legacy government form Roman Autocracy.
- Made the Strategoi & Exarchoi estates' events not require the Cossacks DLC.
- Finished off Greek localisation of new provinces in Crimea & Crete, plus Neapolitan holdings and Latium/Rome. The rest will come in a future update.
- Started working on a new mechanic for the Latin Empire (To be implemented properly).
- Added an event chain that allows for Aragonese intervention in Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, however it very rarely actually happens if AI gets to pick, as happened historically. Call it reverse_local_noble.jpg.
- Added estate support for new Italian city state ideas introduced in BT yet to be introduced in BT proper.

Tweaks:
- Removed the requirements to have the Theme System established to form Rome as Byzantium.
- Re-added the core on Thessaloniki as Draiocht re-added some Byzantine cores in the vicinity.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed the permaclaim hole in Albania-Macedonia. Now these provinces are part of missions again.
- Fixed a discrepancy with the Turkic Question mission's highlighting and actual requirements.
- Fixed BR overwriting BT Candia files.
- Fixed the March of Alania decision accidentally using an Italian minor tag.
- Fixed Byzantine Silk event firing after having gotten Faceting. This currently blocks you out of the event chain entirely, but let's keep it that way for now.
- Fixed the Latin Empire being formable as a subject, causing some funky issues.

Things to do:
- Fix the Latin Empire duchies/knightly orders' claims and add new duchies in regions where fitting. This shit is taking ages to do and is still not done.


############################################

Byz Resurgence 3.0.2

Features:
- Added compatibility for the Dharma Government Reform system for Byzantium. The system is currently not complete, and I'm planning a slightly different system in the future. For now, this'll do however.

Tweaks:
- Removed the permaclaims given from the Theme System decision.
- Tweaked the Byz Resurgence CB to not work on provinces in Carpathia, now that Dobruja belongs to the Balkans instead. 

Bugfixes:
- Fixed the Roman Autocracy government form now showing up as a button in the Reform screen.
- Fixed numerous bugs as a result of old files causing issues.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 3.0.1

Bugfixes:
- Actually updated the 3.0 changelog to more accurately represent what features are in the mod currently.
- Fixed Thessalonica & Constantinople not having proper trade centers.


############################################

Byz Resurgence 3.0

Updated to BT 10.0

Features:
- Once more readjusted the mission tree, courtesy of ZombiePowered for a brand new mission layout, which, hopefully, is less confusing and has less crossing arrows.
- Added a bunch more mission modifiers in an attempt to diversify them, especially towards the late tree in order to get rid of the spammed Imperial Ambitions.
- Due to popular demand, I have now made it so that once you conquer a whole region belonging to an Exarch, the specific capitals of tag will switch to the specific culture of that region.
- Added five new missions to the mission tree.
	- One is a mission to cover all Mediterranean trade.
	- Another one is a mission that deals with creating an Imperial Army, as that was sorely missing from the mission tree.
	- The final one deals with a Byzantine Indian Trade Company, after integrating Mesopotamia.
	- Split up Ottoman Greece mission to accomodate for the new provinces in the Balkans
	- Split up Central Italy mission to accomodate for new provinces in Central Italy
- FINALLY added a Persia mission tree, spanning Alexander the Great's conquests.
- The Holy Byzantine Empire:
	- If you are the emperor of the HRE, you can now enact the decision of Renovatio Imperii by passing Revoke the Privilegia, while also having 50 Imperial Authority.
	- If you do, the decision fires an event that works similar to the Renovatio Imperii reform, integrating all HRE princes while tag-switching you to the Roman Empire instead of the Holy Roman Empire.
	- NB: Please note that this feature is currently untested, however my eyes see no real bugs in the code. Tread lightly and report any bugs you notice!
- Added a triggered province modifier that takes effect once an Orthodox province is owned by a Catholic nation known as "Schismatic Relations", giving -3% local missionary strength while also giving -4 local unrest (For balance).
	- This modifier disappears at the end of the Age of Discovery, marking the start of the Age of Reformation.
	- This modifier also does not apply for a Catholic Byzantium, for obvious reasons.
- Added the ability for Achaea & Neopatria to restore the Latin Empire (For earlier start support).
- Also added permanent claims for any Exarches established, as to allow the player to figure out what provinces are intended to be owned by said Exarch.
- Added a 'Russia buff' that attempts to fix the broken army composition of Russia or whoever has the Russian government mechanics by railroading artillery recruitment through event if certain conditions are met.
	- While it is intended for Russia, it does railroad any nation that has the Russian government mechanics.
	- This particular mechanic also comes with a slight change to the Russian idea set, giving them -20% land maintenance modifier instead of +50% land force limit.
- Added an event that allows the country to remove a sufi shrine within their borders if its province has been converted away from islam.
- Added the Iqta mechanics to Byzantium's unique starting government, the Roman Autocracy (Also tweaked), as they historically employed Pronoiar, which were taxable land grants, much like the Iqta system.
- Added some flavour events regarding the Triumphal Quadriga. The plan is to expand upon this and create quadrennial horse races, but due to time constraints, it has yet to happen.

Tweaks:
- Adjusted the advisor gain from the Strategoi estate to always grant a Provincial governor if you own more than 200 provinces, as it seemed that estate interactions cannot handle random_list.
- Removed stability gain from re-establishing the Theme System.
- Changed Northern Chersonese mission to require an East slavic-cultured country to either be allied OR a subject.
- Added the requirement to the Varangian Guard decision from Renovatio Imperii to require the Basilics law idea.
- Adjusted the Theme System modifier from 25% manpower modifier to 25% land forcelimit modifier. The Anatolian Restoration mission already gives enough manpower.
- Removed power gains from Anatolian Restoration mission.
- Adjusted the Roman Empire requirement so that the Holy Roman Empire tag also cannot exist in order for you to form the Roman Empire.
- Adjusted the War of Two Romes CB so that it is not a one-time use, but rather is available once Byzantium has completed their mission to establish the Exarches (Or any other country who has the flag "byz_challenged_hremperor" set to them).
	- This also makes it so that the CB is valid on whoever is currently the Emperor.
	- Also adjusted the CB to give a -30 reluctance to peace out.
- Adjusted so that the Exarches formation decisions use the "release" effect instead of ceding provinces, thus avoiding funky stuff such as the newly formed Exarch spawning without ideas or any part of the map explored.
- Removed +1 tolerance of true faith from the Patriarch of Mecca & Medina modifier, as the Conquest of Mecca already gives +1 tolerance of true faith.
- Adjusted LTE Knightly Orders Epirus (EPI) & Crete (CRT) to new tags Epirus (EPR) & Candia (CND), as to avoid weird conflicts with the new unit packs.
- Sped up recruitment speed of the heavy ships spawned during the Incorporate Mesopotamia mission as to avoid the situation where the explorer dies before the ships can be finished.
- Removed Byzantine startup cores in Anatolia. Reason being:
	- It made AI Byzantium give away some of these cores to its vassal Lesbos due to Lesbos bordering the provinces and Byzantium did not.
	- It basically gave Byzantium the ability to freely convert the provinces, as the provincial unrest would be 0 after being given to loyal Clergy and raised autonomy, which started at 0 anyway because it was a core.
	- It allowed the Byzantines to directly reconquer the provinces with 0 nationalism, thus allowing direct culture conversion, assuming they could convert the provinces to Orthodox.
	- It caused major prestige bleeding to Byzantium if they did not have a truce with the Ottomans.
- Adjuted Recover Ottoman Greece mission to give permaclaims instead of cores on Western Anatolia to accomodate for the removal of the startup cores.
- Tweaked the Succession Crisis:
	- It now allows Komnenos or Gothia even if the countries don't exist. They do however require Byzantium to personally own their historical capitals.
	- Changed Laskarids to rise from BT Nicaea instead of (vanilla) Prousa.
- Adjusted Pentarchy decisions and mission to be allowed if the provinces were owned by a subject as well, like many missions.
- Reduced some modifiers' legitimacy and prestige bonuses (Especially the permanent ones), because you'd literally get infinite amounts towards the end game.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed a bug with BT on_actions.
- Fixed missing localisation on event integrated_byz_events.33.
- Fixed missing localisation for modifier integrated_searching_for_better_allies.
- Fixed mission "A Question of Schismatics" requiring having recovered West Anatolia instead of Ottoman Greece.
- Fixed resurgent_BYZ.17 lacking an event picture.
- Strategoi disaster now correctly applies -25% national manpower modifier instead of -250 manpower.
- Fixed mission Protect Lesser Armenia not granting claims to Subjugate Lazica.
- Fixed a potential bug with localisation past resurgent_BYZ.16. Whether it exists in the released version or cropped up while bugfixing, I don't know.
- Fixed the March of Dacia being establishable if Dacia somehow was created without Byzantium passing the decision (Which happened in my test-game).
	- Also configured the March of Alania to work similarily.
- Fixed the March of Alania being establishable by the means of any subject nation, including a massive Muscovy PU. Let's just say it was funny to me.
- Also fixed the March of Alania erroneously referring to Karchidon instead of Alania when trigger-checking.
- Fixed Byzantine colonies being called Curopalates.
- Fixed the Hajduk Infantry erroneously being spelled Hadjuk.
- Fixed Estate advisors not implementing the new vanilla feature of having culture & religion from a random province that is owned by the Estate.
	- Also tweaked the Strategoi & Exarches estate advisors to work similarily.
- Fixed a localisation bug with an event where because the event was a province_event, the custom localisation would break if the culture of the province was not in the Hellenic culture group.
- Fixed a similar localisation bug on the Exarches estate events if the player got the event before revoking Exarches' autonomy.
- Fixed a broken localisation on the War of the Two Romes peacedeal.
- Fixed a bug with Knightly Orders never becoming available.
- Fixed European Ambitions lasting for 4 years and 290 days instead of 5 years.
- Fixed Form Romanian Nation decision appearing twice.
- Fixed Exarchate of Alexandria not being recognized as an Exarchate by a scripted trigger.
- Fixed Major Exarch Seat Bonus province triggered modifier not showing up when it should.
- Fixed missing localisation on several (Read: All) Exarches influence modifiers
- Fixed a province highlighting bug for the mission "Convert Anatolia" if Byzantium was not Orthodox.
- Fixed country colours of Alexandria & Anatolia from their identical pink colours that were leftover from a copy-paste.
- Fixed Subjugate Lazica applying "military_expansionism", a now deprecated BT modifier.
- Fixed African Ambitions erroneously giving "trade_range" instead of "trade_range_modifier".
- Cleaned up a bunch in the country formation files as BT moved towards consolidating them instead, thus removing any potential duplicate country formation decisions.
- Fixed Exarches seemingly being establishable from PU's.
- Fixed an edge-case situation where Byzantium could tag-switch into Morea through event while at war, causing all sorts of vanilla bugs.
- Fixed bug with LTE names and generals showing up with weird, incorrect characters.
- Fixed the Strategoi disaster ending immediately if you had 3 stability upon it firing.
- Also fixed the Succession Crisis that had a similar issue.
- Fixed an edge-case situation where if a Byzantium that tag-switched to Roman Empire got their missions updated, they would lose their mission tree.

Misc:
- Did some minor restructuring of localisation files.
- Made attempts at finally updating the Greek localisation for Persia.
- Actually adjusted the startup event's title from age-old version 1.2.
- Adjusted the loyalty modifier text for Strategoi for between 25-50 army tradition to state "below 50 army tradition" instead of "above 25 army tradition" as the modifier was negative.
- Minor dynamic province name changes.
- Created new tags for Epirus & Candia for the purposes of Latin Empire Knightly Orders.
- Adjusted DYR's flag to the Anjou-Durazzo coat of arms.
- Removed minor localisation for Romanian by request of Vlad, author of Romanian Awakening.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 2.1.4

Bugfixes:
- Fixed the Recover West Anatolia mission erroneously claiming rewarding cores on all of Anatolia.
- Bugfixed a bit on the Genoese Purchase event as it was slightly broken in some ways. May still have some bugs I haven't ironed out, though.
- Fixed the Schismatics decisions adding province triggered modifiers without hiding them, resulting in a vanilla localisation error.
- Fixed the Alania decision's repeatability, erroneously disabling the March of Dacia decision instead.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 2.1.3

Features:
- Added a CB for Byzantium that dismantles the HRE for 80 WS upon establishing the Exarches.
- Added the Knightly Orders estate, however lacks estate interactions, localisation as well as estate events.

Bugfixes:
- Removed the concept that granting a province to the Exarches would remove any provinces in the state from the strategoi as it apparently removed every single estate in the state.
- Fixed the Anatolian Reclamation applying the province modifier to every province instead of only east Anatolia.
- Fixed the Imperial Co-capital accidentally targetting Edirne instead of Thessalonica.
- Fixed the Pentarchy mission granting the vanilla modifier instead of the mod's version of it.
- Fixed the Ottoman Greece mission granting cores instead of permanent claims on the Safeguard the Balkan Border provinces.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 2.1.2

Bugfixes:
- Fixed the missing mission triggers for Mecca & Medina, Cyrenaica & Arabia.
- Fixed the development modifier for the Anatolian Restoration modifier being global, resulting in 5 dev cost Constantinople.
- Fixed the estate icons being off-center and removed the temporary declaration of the Knightly Orders estate until implemented (Apparently I seem to have missed saving the .dds file containing the Crusader Helmet... oh well).

############################################

Byz Resurgence 2.1.1

Features:
- Rush-coded in the March of Alania decision for Smartguy725 specifically that was mentioned in the changelog previously. A new game may have some issues here.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed a missing parenthesis in the Convert to Catholicism decision breaking it.
- Fixed the Persis Exarchate scripted trigger to actually work. *
- Fixed Aegyptus exarchate decision using same decision ID, plus an error regarding it that would change Alexandria to Antiochian culture.


############################################

Byz Resurgence 2.1.0

Features:
- Reoverhauled the Mission Tree once more, now featuring a bunch of missions that do not relate to Byzantine conquests. Especially the early missions have been split up. The old missions still exist.
- Especially the tree concerning early Ottoman expansion and the one dealing with Venice have been expanded.
- The mission system includes:
	- Development missions for the provinces Constantinople, Thessalonica & all of Anatolia
	- Diplomatic missions such as gathering allies at the start and befriending your Slavic religious brethren in the North.
	- A trade mission to give Byzantium some merchants as they were sorely lacking them.
	- Religious missions that include embracing either Catholicism or staying Orthodox and becoming the Defender of Faith to start crusading.
	- A mission with what to do with the Turk - accept them and gain valuable Turkic Horse Archers, or culturally enrich them for other bonuses.
- Added an event that allows Byzantium to purchase Chios off Genoa as Byzantium resurges (Triggered by mission). Whether Genoa goes ahead with the purchase depends on many factors, especially on ruler personalities.
- Added the Exarchate of Alexandria, mysteriously missing from previous iterations of the mod.
- Added a tooltip to the initialisation event that explicitly tells you which option is which, as the cynical option names could potentially cause confusion for the unknowing.
- The Latin Empire has a specific type of vassal that calculates liberty desire independently of one another. These are allowed upon picking up the 5th idea.
- This allows you to create a vassal-swarm state akin to that of the HRE.
- Added decisions for the Latin Empire to establish historical and ahistorical crusader states/duchies as vassals. These include:
	- Vanilla:
	- Achaea, Athens, Epirus, Naxos, Corfu (Cephalonia), Candia, Cyprus, Jerusalem
	- BT:
	- Cilicia, Lesbos.
	- Imported from Shattered Europa:
	- Neopatria, Negroponte, Antioch, Edessa, Tripoli & Vaspurakania
	- Brand new:
	- Philippopolis, Thessalonica, Nicopolis, Varna, Nicaea, Dyrrachium, Armeniacum, Paphlagonia, Anatolia, Thracesium, Samus, Charsianum, Colonia, Cibyrraeum, Mesopotamia, Chaldea & Chersum
	-... For a total of 33 (!) potential vassals that you can swarm the heathen with.
	- Luckily, these vassals calculate their Liberty Desire independently of one another.
	- However, to counterbalance this, each province owned by the Latin Empire increases liberty desire in subjects by an amount that is dependent on the total number of provinces directly owned by the Latin Empire.
	- This is done to force the player into a very vassal-centric style of play.
	- Eventually in the Age of Absolutism, it is possible to revoke this Crusader state authority, similar to that of Exarches, which integrates all the crusader states and removes this LD modifier.

Tweaks:
- Adjusted the requirements for Byzantium converting to Catholicism. For some weird reason, Byzantium would almost always do it on their own as AI.
- Did MANY adjustments to the mission tree in an attempt to remove duplicate modifiers (Except past the Exarches - At that point, Imperial Ambitions is the only thing that matters and makes sense) and rebalance the tree.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed tooltip on Convert Asia Minor & Anatolia to properly indicate direct ownership is required.
- Finally found out why the [Country] Sends Supplies always picked Byzantium and fixed it (Hint: It has to do with parentheses)
- Fixed the Succession Crisis events allowing you to let more than one pretender take the throne.
- Fixed a compatibility bug with BT where this mod would disable the Tanistry events for Ireland and hotfixes in BT.
- Fixed Latin Empire being formable by Byzantium if they converted to Catholicism.

Miscellaneous:
- Changed Antiochian to Antiochene
- Replaced the now-deprecated Religious Center permanent province modifier with that of a similar modifier applicable to Orthodox holy cities instead.
- Did a hell of a lot of cleanup regarding duplicate names and similar in the country files.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 2.0.6

Bugfixes:
- Fixed being able to establish Exarchates after reducing Exarch autonomy (The decisions were checking for reduced_exarch_autonomy flag, not revoked_exarch_autonomy)
- Fixed albian being misspelled "albiian" in Establish Exarchate of Albion decision, resulting in Londinion getting No Culture.

Miscellaneous:
- Integrated new 1.25 trigger for Exarch territory modifier.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 2.0.5

Feature:
- Adjusted Recover Albania's mission reward from Balkan Ambition to a new modifier that decreases recruitment time of ships and regiments for 5 years.
- Added 50 prosperity to the Thrace and Macedonia areas as a mission reward for Safeguard the Balkan Border.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed Besarabia not being part of March of Dacia province highlighting
- Fixed el-Arish/Rhinokoloura not being part of Lower Egypt mission.
- Fixed Ottomans not actually declaring war if saying the city shall be theirs during the City of the World's Desire event.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 2.0.4

Bugfixes:
- Turn the Tide no longer gives claims to the Recover Albania mission. Instead, Recover Greece does, as intended.
- byz_naval_ambition now has proper localisation.
- Exarchate decisions now properly change the culture of their granted province.
- The subject that is turned into the Exarchate if the province is controlled by them now has their primary culture changed to what it is supposed to be for the relevant Exarchate.
- Fixed Protect Lesser Armenia not giving claims to Crusade for Syria.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 2.0.3

Bugfixes:
- Fixed some horrible bugs with regards to the Exarchates that had Byzantium release them as independent instead of as an Exarch.
- Fixed a lot of other bugs with regards to Exarchates, ranging from liberty desire calculations to accidental use of adjective naming for Albion. Here's hoping they now behave as planned.
- Fixed two provinces in France not being part of any mission.
- Fixed the mission for Raetia-Noricum erroneously granting claims to Roman Galicia.
- Fixed a localisation issue in the claims granted for Lower Egypt in Crusade for Palestine
- Fixed event resurgent_BYZ.12 lacking localisation.
- Probably fixed a lot of other bugs that I forgot to write down while frantically attempting to fix everything.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 2.0.2

Features:
- Added province highlighting to Reestablish the Theme System & Restore Byzantine Empire decisions.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed Convert Asia Minor & Convert Anatolia trigger

############################################

Byz Resurgence 2.0.1

Features:
- Added province highlighting to the Exarchate establishment decisions
- Added province highlighting to the Latin Empire formation decision.

Bugfixes:
- Adjusted Latin Empire formation's claims not being given to the Latin Empire
- Fixed some buggy Exarch decisions where a province scope was missing that could have unforeseen consequences.

############################################

Byz Resurgence 2.0

Updated to 1.25 for BT 9.0

General:
- Completely overhauled Byzantine Ideas. The new ideas are a compromise of contemporary and medieval Byzantium. The full idea set is following:
	- Traditions: +1 yearly legitimacy, +1 possible advisor
	- Basilics Law: -20% core creation cost
	- Byzantine Renaissance: -10% tech cost
	- Bureau of Barbarians: Unchanged, +20% improve relations
	- Reinstitute the Pronoia: -20% infantry cost
	- Formalize Succession Laws: -10% stability cost, +25% heir chance
	- Repopulation of the Countryside: -10% development cost, -20% culture conversion cost
	- Byzantine Resurgence: +2 yearly prestige
	- Ambitions: Unchanged. +5 max states
- Due to adjusted ideas, the decisions inoorporated from Renovatio Imperii have had their requirements adjusted.
- As the Ecumenical Patriarch idea is now gone, the event that granted the religious center modifier to Constantinople is now gone. In turn, Constantinople now starts as a religious center.
- Added two province modifiers for Constantinople and Thessaloniki, with the first representing the Ecumenical Patriarch and the second one referencing Mount Athos. The modifiers change upon conquest by a muslim ruler and disappear completely upon the province being converted away from Orthodox. Any other religious denomination gets no modifier.
- Overhauled the Byzantine start:
	- Byzantium now start as a tributary to the Ottomans, as they did historically. This of course only works if you have the Mandate of Heaven DLC. Do note that the Ottomans AI is very quick on revoking the agreement, so do not expect it to last.
	- Switched Byzantium's government form back to Feudal Monarchy, as the Empire was by every definition except hereditary rule a feudal moanrchy.
	- This also results in the removal of the annoying Nobility Decadence.
	- This also adjusts the Succession Crisis disaster to occur only if the idea "Formalize Succession Laws" has not been taken, unlike before where it simply required the government form.
	- The previous Roman Monarchy government form is now available upon either controlling both Constantinople & Rome, or reaching the Age of Absolutism, as a mean to show a "return to form" Byzantium of the 8-11th centuries.
		- The Roman Monarchy also has had its flavour text reworked as to indicate that non-hereditary rule is not a defining characteristic for the government form.
	- The Roman Monarchy has had its bonuses reworked:
		- -25% harsh treatment cost
		- -25% autonomy change cooldown
		- -0.10 monthly autonomy change
		- +0.1 yearly absolutism
		- +10 max absolutism
		- Has logothete (Factions) and loses the Nobility/Dynatoi estate. The factions made little sense to Byzantium at game start anyway as they were barely influential.
		- This of course causes the "Factions influence ruler" events to not pop up before this point.
- Speaking of which, the Purple Phoenix DLC events have had a major rework:
	- All of the monarch point gains have been removed entirely. In return, legitimacy and prestige (And in the case of "Turks driven from X" army tradition) is gained instead. Monarch points made no sense.
	- The "Triumph for X" missions have been removed, as you can already hold a military parade as an estate interaction with the Strategoi. This should hopefully somewhat help the army tradition bloat that happens when playing as Byzantium.
	- The "Civil War" event that could fire before has returned to requiring a formalization of succession laws. I also discovered a bug that if Byzantium got a regency, but had very high legitimacy, the event would fire without giving any options. I thus added the option of naming one of your generals as the ruler, or if no general exists, a random noble. This also happens to be the way the Palaiologoi made it onto the throne. Read more in the:
- Added custom startup screen for Byzantium, detailing what has happened with Byzantium from the failed Battle of Mantzikert up until now. While doing this, I also discovered there is a character limit to the startup text.
- Completely overhauled the mission tree (again) for 1.25.
	- Most 1.24 missions can be found in this tree. Some have been merged or removed, however.
		- This is due to the lack of ability to represent all the different paths in a 5 slot wide mission system.
		- Some missions were also deemed superfluous, such as conquering Jerusalem when the Palestine mission already only covers that area.
	- The Annihilate Venice mission has been integrated into the mission system as to allow for the new flavour event introduced in 1.25.
	- The only other vanilla missions in the tree are Convert Asia Minor & Restore the Pentarchy. The rest are either old missions pre-1.25 or brand new ones.
	- (Most) Missions that previously would grant a vassalize CB have had this CB included in the respective "Conquer X" mission.
	- Some missions give a subjugation CB on a less-than-100-dev country that the mission concerns.
		- Special case for the ones in Italy, where any country whose capital is in one of the provinces regarding the mission is a target for this.
	- An additional mission chain that requires the establishment of the Exarches allows for further conquests, granting missions to restore the Roman Empire's borders.
	
- Added two new advisors currently unique to Byzantium, perhaps planning on allowing their recruitment from things such as the Byzantine Refugees event and similar:
	- Added the Military General, which grants yearly army tradition. This is only recruitable from the Strategoi estate interaction "Recruit Minister" (80% chance).
	- Added the Provincial Governor, which grants reduced core creation cost. This is recruitable from either the Strategoi estate interaction "Recruit Minister" (20% chance) or the new estate Exarches' similarly named interaction (Guaranteed).
- Buffed Manuel II (Will never be seen in a 1444 start) to a 2/4/3 from a 1/2/1
- Buffed Ioannes VIII to a 2/4/2 from a 2/2/2
- Nerfed Konstantinos XI to a 3/4/4 from a 4/5/4
- Changed both of the above rulers' religion to Catholic due to the ratification of the Council of Florence in 1439.
	
Decisions:
- Adjusted the Schism decisions; Restoring either the Pentarchy or mending the Oriental Schism gives a religious center to the cities required for restoration/mending.
- Nerfed the Theme system decision to only grant claims in Greece and Anatolia. It was deemed too powerful to get all the claims you did.
- Added the option to reform the Latin Empire to the Knights, Cyprus, Provence, Athens, Lesbos, Naxos & Corfu, and an option for Venice & Genoa to establish it as a vassal if they control Constantinople.
	- Added Latin Empire ideas, based heavily on using vassals:
		Traditions: +2 Tolerance of the True Faith, +50% Vassal income
		Adapt Greek Administrators: +10% National Tax Modifier
		The City of Cities: +1 yearly Prestige
		Invite Italian Merchants: +15% Global Trade Power
		Induct Knightly Orders: +10% Morale of Armies, +300% Vassal Forcelimit Contribution
		Modernizing the Themata: -10% Land Maintenance Modifier. Allows the Strategoi estate.
		Reform East Latin Rites: +1% Missionary Strength against Heretics
		Eternal Crusade: Triple manpower increase in religious wars
		Ambitions: -15% subject liberty desire from development
	
Events:
- Allowed the player to use un-integrated Purple Phoenix Events by a startup event. Be wary that the un-integrated events have not been tested for either balance or bugs, and may as such cause issues. I may fix these if bothered enough.
- Added an event to expand the Tyrian Purple industry upon conquering Tyros. Your options are:
	- Expand it further, changing Tyros' trade goods to Dyes, changing some provinces that produce cloth into producing Silk and changes some coastal provinces into producing Dyes. This runs the possibility of depleting the Murex snail supply in the future.
	- Do not
	- If your ruler is Calm or Careful, you can limit the expansion to Tyros. This does not risk the Murex snail depletion.
- Added an event "City of the World's Desire", functioning very similar to that of the Surrender of Maine event. The event fires if Mehmet II is the ruler and the year is after 1450. Unless Byzantium has managed to ally one of Ottoman's rivals, this almost always ensures they declare war on them (80/20 chance).
	- If Byzantium has allied someone that rivals the Ottomans, the chances are about reverted to a 16.7% (1/6) chance of declaring.
- Adjusted Byzantine Greek Fire MTTH because it happened way too frequently in my test runs.
- Added a repurposed Demetrios Palaiologos pretender event to the integrated byzantine events which fires upon the death of Ioannes VIII if before 1460.
	- The event is currently very cheese-able to compensate for it spawning in Constantinople instead of Selymbria, which lacks representation currently. However, once the province gets added, which will probably be soon, you can bet the rebellion fires immediately.
- Completely removed the Help from the Pope event chain as it was very ahistorical and stupidly scripted. I may intend to adjust this later on, but it served very little purpose.

Strategoi estate:	
- Tweaked Strategoi estate's influence gain to 1%/1% land instead of 1.5%/1%. You'll probably end up granting them close to 40% of your state development anyway
- Adjusted Strategoi province revocation to only spawn rebels if Strategoi are not loyal (I.e below 60% loyalty).

Exarches:
- Added a brand new Exarch system:
	- Becomes available upon Byzantium owning enough land outside of the Balkans and Anatolia. If you've played England in Beyond Typus and established the Kingdom of Ireland, this'll sound familiar. Establishing the Exarches grants a malus to max absolutism.
	- At first, it allows for the establishment of Exarchates. Due to the inability to conditionally allow the creation of client states outside of dip tech, it enables a bunch of decisions for regions historically having had an exarch, or regions deemed far away from Constantinople.
	- The exarch states are: Ravenna/Italy if capital is in Constantinople, Karchidon/Africa, Gallia/France, Hesperia/Iberia, Albion/England, Persis/Persia, Anatolia/Orient if capital is moved to Italy
	- If desired, I may also add Exarches of Germania, Aegyptus/Egypt and Indus.
	- The exarches are a unique subject type that is a mix of a vassal and a march, that at the same time calculates liberty desire like personal unions do, i.e individually.
	- Each exarch also has a unique culture belonging to the Hellenic group. This is akin to that of a yet-to-be-implemented Colonial Culture system in BT. Essentially, it simulates the spread of Greek as a language to these areas, akin to the Hellenism of old.
	- Beware! Once an Exarch has been established in the region, no areas in that region can be stated, thus encouraging you to grant the provinces to the Exarch instead.
	- The exarch states also have access to a unique set of ideas:
		- Traditions: +10% Trade Steering, +1 Naval leader manuever
		- Protector of the Emperor: +10% Morale of Armies, +1 yearly Legitimacy
		- Incorporate Far Lands: -10% Core Creation Cost, -15% State Maintenance modifier
		- Ruler of Barbarians: -15% Culture Conversion Cost, No negative tolerance malus
		- Exarchate Governor: +1 Diplomatic Reputation
		- The Exarch's Standing Army: -10% Land Maintenance modifier
		- Spread The Word: +2% missionary strength, +25% institution spread
		- Exarch Themata: -10% Land Maintenance Modifier. Allows the Strategoi estate.
		- Ambitions: +50% sailors
	- The exarch states also get a unique monarchy type, the Exarchate, which grants +20% admin efficiency (Approximately 50 absolutism), to compensate for them spawning at 0 absolutism no matter that of its overlord and how incompetent the AI is at obtaining absolutism.
		- The bonus is very powerful and depending on balance reports, I may nerf it. However I currently deem it very necessary.
	- Upon re-establishing the Roman Empire, it is possible to integrate these Exarch lands via decision that reduces their autonomy. Doing so disables the establishment of further exarch states and allows for the new Exarches estate to appear.
	- The Exarches estate has a simple system where any province in a region can be granted to the Exarches, but only one province. Depending on the province development (10/20/30) they grant +3/5/8 max states and a region-wide 33% autonomy floor.
	- The Exarches estate has some new interactions:
		- Grant local autonomy, which adds 10% autonomy to every province in the same region as that of a province controlled by the Exarches. In return, it grants a lot of loyalty and if Exarches influence is high, bonus stability.
		- Place relative as Exarch, reducing their influence, sparking a revolt, but also allows for:
		- Designating Exarch as heir, which grants a good heir if none exists.
		- Drafting an Exarch's Eparch, granting a good general.
		- Drafting Exarch troops, granting bonus manpower.
		- Recruit Minister, granting a brand new provincial governor minister.
	- The Exarches estate has 4 estate events that can occur. These can also occur if there are any Exarchates.
	
Bugfixes:
- Did some minor province naming adjustments to certain cities.
- Adjusted dynasty misspellings of Byzantine names (from vanilla).
- Fixed flavor_BYZ.36 requiring a misspelled province modifier, thus never firing.
- Fixed a Strategoi event that speaks of great Strategoi influence that does not actually require Strategoi influence to be high at all.
- Fixed the decision of restoring Byzantium to granting claims to Byzantium instead of "ROOT", as ROOT was still referring to whatever country that formed it.
- Attempted fix of a bug in the Succession Crisis disaster that disallowed it from firing if having a regency council.
	
Miscellaneous	
- Reorganized a lot of the mod into different files.

Byzantine Resurgence 1.1.4 - The Tyrian Purple Patch

Changelog:
	- Adjusted Byzantium's colour and flag to that of Tyrian Purple due to a colour code I found actually looking really nice. If you prefer the old one, there is a tutorial file packed with the mod to teach you how to go back to the old colours.
	- Bugfixed several issues with the Military Coup and Succession Crisis disasters, such as the latter being able to occur even when having another disaster and general tweaking of the requirements, as well as allowing Pretender rebels to end both disasters if enforcing demands.
	- Bugfixed event flavor_BYZ.2: The Genoese Merchants to now actually granting provinces and actually having localized names.
	- Added new event: Reestablishment of Tyrian Purple dye that, if having restored Byzantine Silk, gives the option of producing Dyes in Smyrna, as well as adding other related modifiers.
	- Fixed opinion modifiers being missing from the previously integrated Byzantium Events mod
